i voted no on the motion to adjourn motions to adjourn are sometimes made in protest or so members of congress can make a point by rejecting them but im told the point of this vote was simply to extend the current session by a few minutes presumably so leadership can whip us on an upcoming vote the motion failed 1415
senator ayotte released the following statement regarding the department of veterans affairs patient access audit released today which found that more than 57000 veterans are currently waiting for appointments at va facilities across the country the report indicated that the va medical center in manchester and the va hospital in white river junction both of which serve new hampshire veterans are not among those flagged for further review and investigation no veteran should have to wait more than 90 days for an appointment and new hampshire veterans should be given the choice of seeing a private provider so they dont have to wait in line or be forced to travel hours to seek care said senator ayotte the bipartisan va reform legislation being crafted in the senate will help address the systemic nationwide problems detailed in the audit released today and im hopeful the senate will quickly take up this legislation once its finalized to make sure veterans can get the timely care they deserve

this morning i offered an amendment to reform the emergency unemployment compensation euc program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full senate that would extend unemployment benefits my amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force the amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving euc benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work defined as work within their capabilities or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency states would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws we need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits i have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out this undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment we are waiting to see if majority leader harry reid will allow votes on republican amendments

i have written before about president obamas apparent failure to read his daily security briefings i think this comment from him sums up exactly what i mean throwing clapper under the bus along the way our head of the intelligence community jim clapper obama said has acknowledged that i think they underestimated what had been taking place in syria but in reality the administration was warned all along about the rise of isisisil defense intelligence director lt gen michael flynn had warned president obama and repeated that info to congress from the attached article by february 2014 we had generals basically reading out their memos to congress he added referring to testimony from lieutenant general michael flynn the director of the defense intelligence agency flynn predicted isis probably will attempt to take territory in iraq and syria to exhibit its strength in 2014 the islamist terror group had already seized fallujah and ramadi he said had the ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in syria by the time flynn spoke on capitol hill congress had already heard the story at least once before assistant secretary of state brett mcgurk told a house foreign affairs subcommittee in november 2013 that isis had been militarily active all year because of a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of iraqi security forces poor operational tactics and popular grievances which remain unaddressed it has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in syria control of lucrative facilities there such as oil wells and regular movement of weapons and fighters between syria and iraq mcgurk said

today the house passed hr 5 the student success act i voted in favor of it because it restores local control of education by eliminating adequate yearly progress ayp the no child left behind report card requirement eliminating federal highly certified teacher requirements eliminating the federal governments ability to tell states how to spend their own education money maintenance of effort keeping federal funding at sequestration levels consolidating 70 funding programs into one single grant program eliminating taxpayer funded management positions at the department of education headquarters and blocking the federal government from mandating common core standards amendments also passed to remove federally mandated teacher evaluation requirements and to make title i dollars portable for public schools and charter schools if a state so chooses id like to thank everyone who responded to my facebook posts asking for feedback on this issue i read them all and your feedback helped me make decisions on dozens of amendments and on the overall passage of this bill i offered an amendment that would have gone even further in removing the federal government from education but unfortunately it was ruled out of order and was never considered however this bill does represent great progress in this area

yesterday speaking on the floor of the house of representatives i shared a story that is close to my heart a few years ago my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart due to her advanced age the doctors believed that surgery was too risky a few years later that aneurysm got worse endangering her life she was reevaluated and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery putting her faith in her doctors in our healthcare system and in her god she chose to have the surgery fortunately she made a full recovery however none of this would have been possible without medicare my mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker and did not have a private pension or any option other than medicare as congressional republicans look for an easy way out on these issues it is people like my mother who are left behind this is a personal issue to me and the millions of american families with similar stories republicans have tried for years to destroy medicare by turning it in to a voucher program they would break the promise we made to our nations seniors that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country boasting an overhead of only 2 the problem isnt medicare its the rising cost of healthcare one major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other we must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare as the representative of silicon valley i have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine personal health connected devices and other tools i will be reintroducing the healthcare innovation and marketplace technologies act later this year to continue this effort most importantly however i will continue to stand with my friends here in the congress to protect medicare and the medicare guarantee

todays jobs report is no cause for celebration the reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because americans are leaving the workforce in fact the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years we need to focus on creating an environment where innovation small business and entrepreneurship can thrive that means removing roadblocks to job creation like obamacare and doddfrank and making america more energy independent at the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people left behind by the governments calculation read more from the associated press the drop in the unemployment rate in august to a 4year low was hardly cause for celebration the rate fell because more people stopped looking for work more than 300000 people stopped working or looking for a job their exodus shrank the socalled labor force participation rate the percentage of adult americans with a job or seeking one to 632 percent its the lowest participation rate since august 1978 once people without a job stop looking for one the government no longer counts them as unemployed thats why the unemployment rate dropped to 73 percent in august from 74 percent in july even though 115000 fewer people said they had jobs if those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work the unemployment rate would have risen to 75 percent in august fewerworkingageamericansareworking

more debt w zero spending reforms unacceptable i strongly believe we must act to avoid defaulting on our debt payments and reopen the government but i cannot support a plan that increases our nations debt by half a trillion dollars while offering no spending reforms washingtons addiction to spending is what led to this mess and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach a better way forward would be honest simple legislation that 1 takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms 2 provides temporary government funding and 3 allows us time to work toward a real budget i know a majority of republicans and democrats would ultimately support such a plan the problem is the shutdown strategy damaged the houses bargaining power in these negotiations i hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular americans striving to protect americans from obamacares harmful mandates and taxes setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit and pushing a progrowth agenda that will help create jobs for people in alabama and throughout the country robytovotenoon

for the past few weeks i have been undecided but leaning against authorizing military strikes in syria i was willing to remain open until president obama could make his case to the american people which he did from the east room last night after listening to the speech i have not been persuaded to support military action in syria unfortunately the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives it also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike this is consistent with the lack of detail i have received in classified briefings with administration officials at the very least clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before i would consider supporting military action i hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation but i also realize that a deal brokered by the russians is unlikely to be on balance a very good deal and will remain difficult to implement while we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out the white house must engage congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far
