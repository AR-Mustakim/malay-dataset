for several weeks i have heard from numerous young people across idaho concerned about the interest rate hike on student loans last night senator jim risch and i supported the bipartisan student loan bill to bring interest rates back down to 386 percent from 68 percent this student loan measure will make it less expensive for students to plan for college and it links rates to the financial markets i would prefer to return to the private sector handling student loans to reduce government bureaucracy but action was needed and we were able to reach agreement on a bipartisan solution to help idahos young people

senator corker released the following statement today regarding reports that three of the companies offering insurance policies in the federal health care marketplace in tennessee have requested to raise rates for their exchange plans in 2015 my heart goes out to the many families and business owners across the state coping with rising health care costs and im hopeful the senate might finally be allowed to debate ways to provide relief from the damaging effects of this law including solutions to free up the marketplace so affordable plans that meet the actual needs of tennesseans can openly and effectively compete for their business said corker the presidents health care bill was sold to tennesseans and the country as a way to bring down health care costs yet it has done just the opposite as we continue to see double digit increases in the cost of plans bluecross blueshield of tennessee bcbst the only health insurance provider to offer a policy in all 95 volunteer state counties in 2014 is requesting to raise rates by an average of 19 percent for its exchange plans in 2015 cigna is requesting an average rate increase of 75 percent and humana has requested to raise rates by an average of 144 percent during the health care laws 2014 open enrollment period 88 percent of tennesseans chose a bcbst health insurance plan
