its funny how the arguments the shills are making here are still so close to the racist remarks the gop has already admitted to always attacking lazy minorities and young people gtif it hurts a bunch of college kids thats too lazy to get up off their bohunkus sic and get a photo id so be it and if it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that wants the government to give them everything so be it the law is going to kick the democrats in the butt
we are truly following the patterns of how the mandarins took over empires not because of the sword but because control of the endless paper and regulations that do more to stagnate most peoples lives then to do anything productive but then because they dont see what else they can do they write up even more laws and regulations that either do nothing or hinder more freedom and production

to be fair there are many who are only bigots because their religion tells them to be bigots that described me when i was a christian sadly i too believed homosexuality was a sin i spoke out against it when the subject came up i was a bigot when i deconverted and i no longer had a god to tell me it was wrong my bigotry evaporated along with my religious beliefs i had no reason to think homosexuality was anything but perfectly normal for many religion is the reason for the bigotry and not simply the excuse

gt2 churches are antiscience gtdespite growing change many churches are still legalistically antievolution antiglobal warming antiprochoice antienvironment antipsychology antimedicine and antiwomen to name just a few i just dont understand how anyone whos curious and inquisitive would prefer to repeat secular common sense inside of church instead of trying to go deeper into the bibles and the churchs fascinanting philosophy why would such person be called an intellectual also does an intellectual worships science if you go to any humanities college theres no worship of science going on so i was a little disappointed with the article i do feel like a stranger in churches but not because people have any prejudice against me every intellectual is a little rebelious thats not a christian quality
the only people offended by the redskins are white liberals and obama
i havent read the article yet and i have absolutely no clue whatsoever what race a peanut butter and jelly sandwich could be racist against
it sounds to me like this is simply a brief exchange concerning pr strategy theyre both agreeing that sticking to the message of openness to compromise while democrats are saying that they will not accept a compromise on implementation of the affordable care act presents an opportunity to appear more pragmatic and reasonable exactly the face republicans need going forward i lean a little liberal myself but i would have to agree with others who have said that this is not a gaffe by any stretch of the imagination this clip just shows two politicians agreeing that they would like to be seen as the good guys no surprises and certainly no harm there
im curious whether mcauliffes victory changes reddits stance on money in politics considering he is a guy who has never been elected to public office and is riding a wave of out of state money
so the solution to that is having constant upward pressure by creating money out of nothing that is constantly inflating since any deflation is catastrophic because that is often the conclusion of the keynesiannew economics argument that you began people need wealth to trade for other wealth but when our central banking system is such that new money can be printed to drive down interest rates allowing companies to expand and raise wages faster than they would otherwise have been able to and pay for government programs that fall short in budgeting the balance is thrown off there is new money in the system but the same amount of wealth it works great at first creating a boom but eventually the market catches up with the fact that people are trading more paper money for the same amount of stuff and you have a contraction or a bust it is often hard to argue against your statement in a populist setting since what you said is essentially true if people have more money they can spend more money but what you have not taken into account is what french economist frederic bastiat called what is seen and what is unseen i would reccomend reading his essay of the same name and seriously considerin its implications i used to think along the same lines as you until i read it i would also point out that it is small and medium sized businesses that create jobs new businesses are therefore the best path to future job creation however you seem to be possibly indirectly arguing that demand side limitations is what hinders this as someone actively trying to start a business right now i can tell you that demand side has no effect on my business plan as i only intend to sell my product for 310 which is what i believe the market can handle jumping through all the regulatory hoops is killing me though just one quick example out of many if i want to set up my business as an llc in order to secure business loans and give myself a layer of protection in massachusetts i have to pay a 500 registration fee then every single year after that i would have to pay an additional 500 fee for the privledge of filing my annual report with the state this annual report serves noones bennefit but the states i might add if you want new jobs to be created quickly remove all the regulations hindering small business development and if you dont believe that its that bad i would invite you to to ahead and try starting a business yourself
i think the more damning idea is everything we do in this body should be about messaging to win back the senate sessions said i mean i assume he is using hyperbole but the idea that the main goal of the house is to deliver the senate to the republicans is absolutely awful i would really really hope that small government conservatives would have a problem with that as well as libertarians and democrats and anyone other than a teamminded politician
virginia doesnt have party registration so of course ultra far right republicans somehow think they are independents it also means all primaries are open primaries this is why cooch supporters changed it to a caucus late in the game he wouldnt last in an open primary edit meant to say convention same idea essentially choosing without a broad vote
gt if there are other laws that do that has nothing to do with obamacare you should read the article second paragraph gtthe 1993 national voter registration act nvra known as the motor voter law says that dmvs and other state agencies that provide public assistance have to provide voter registration services the reason the ppaca is involved is because it creates new federal and state agencies that provide public assistance gtbesides why is it bad to encourage people to vote high voter turnout usually results in elections going against republicans this is why they try so hard to disenfranchise voters every election cycle

but what can be done too big to fail is a very real thing especially now with so many people retiring and set to retire over the next 10 years or so and so much of their retirement invested in the stock market you take down the major banks and force a massive market correction and you essentially wipe out the life savings of millions of people theres a reason the fed is pumping so much money into the stock market trying to spin up share prices in any way possible because we dont really have any choice
i was thinking during this whole shutdown that republicans were committing political suicide however i logged on to facebook only to see my bat shit crazy family members posting statuses about how obama is shutting down the government like a whiny child because he hasnt got his way and realized that i no longer believe in democracy
gtits the constitution i know nothing about this case and how it was ruled but it was the court that blocked it not the constitution a court could rule that eating ice cream is unconstitutional that doesnt mean the constitution had anything to do with the ruling unless you would like to cite directly what part of the constitution which doesnt mention education at all relates to what he was trying to do there
hmmmm it was next to impossible for me to realize king obama actually apologized for his lies for him take this advice would make my head explode did bill even think about who would then pay for this new healthcare system before he opened his mouth people wanting to keep their plans are undoubtedly the ones paying taxes thus obamacare to begin with democrats are scumbags when it comes to sticking their hands in other peoples pockets

wow uh this guy really doesnt understand what hes talking about at all does he and unfortunately people like this guy are the reason why morgan freeman does not believe in god because people like this guy force you to choose between science and god here is a excerpt from an interview with morgan freeman q did we invent god a yes q so there isnt a god up in the sky somewhere we came up with god ourselves a well heres a scientific question has anybody ever seen hard evidence what we get is theories from our earlier prophets now people who think that god invented us think that the earth cant be more than 6000 years old so i guess its a question of belief my belief system doesnt support a creator as such as we can call god who created us in hisherits image there are millions of people who believe that god invented us and also think that the idea of a 6000 year old earth is ridiculous but those people are drowned out by folks who find that things like evolution uncomfortable and thus reject it making the faith look foolish by association if the loudest proponents of christianity presented the case for god in a reasonable fashion and admitted that theism is a matter of faith i think wed have far fewer atheists than we have by having those proponents insist that we have empirical proof of god and reject science because it doesnt fit the narrow worldview theyve created for him
yup dont even remember the last time i pirated a video game give me the same service instant sales for tvmovies and ill stop downloading 80 for the dvd of one tv season is not reasonable

former insurance lawyer here its entirely possible that the insurance would only cover the fair market value of the destroyed equipment thats often substantially less than the replacement cost because the fair market value of a 5 year old computer is pretty low but you cant easily buy a 5 year old computer as a replacement other things could have happened as well

my favorite illustration of this january of this year he wrote an opted in the washington times saying we should use drones to protect us from illegals within our borders february of this year he did that insane filibuster over whether obama could use drones within our borders march of this year he said if someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and 50 dollars in cash i dont care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him

i see confederate flags all over michigan it isnt a symbol of southern pride its just fucking racism
this is such a naive view money is literally the most valuable thing you can possess as long as money represents the value of literally every good and service that you can buy with it then money will continue to rule every facet of our society from labor to trade to rule of law to politics and everything in between it is profoundly frustrating as money has absolutely no intrinsic value of its own except as perhaps kindling for fire because its made out of a combustible material but were the ones who give money so much value in our lives money does rule over us and always will until we move into a true postscarcity society and even then well probably still allow money to rule over us because for the most part we are all pretty dumb
i read the introduction gt it is very interesting so far i like how page 3 points out how riddiculous the accepted story is really funny page that said it seems to be pretentious this is the truth ill read more to find out if the rest makes sense thanks for sharing anyway
i dont know about a jar of honey but when i look at the ridiculous infrastructure weve set up here in the us and the resources wasted in the name of homeland security id have to agree that bin laden may very well have won the bigger war the 60 minutes story last night about the trials that are going to be held in guantanamo after 12 years so that justice can be dispensed shows me just how fucked up weve become after those attacks we are still terrified apparently and since 911 was an act of terrorism

republicans see the impending shut down the same as they saw the impending sequester as a crisis they wont have to take responsibility for that can be used for leverage for example if the gop said give us what we want or well defund the government and force it to shut down we could easily point to their deliberate act of defunding the government as a terrorist act instead they seek out a crisis that will occur if they do nothing at all failure to act is not the same as acting this way they can say its not our fault the government shut down we put out a balanced budget just no one wanted it of course no sane person will want their idea of a balanced budget but thats left for pundits and analysts to explain and the only people watching them are the same ones who already know the majority of people are not politically minded and dont tune in all night to political shows or read political periodicals as they see it they are in the cat bird seat do nothing and you can blame the resulting crisis on obama why not they blame everything on him already or get their way in exchange for preventing the shut down so they are not saying give me everything in your house or im going to burn it down they are instead saying give me everything in your house or i wont douse it with my water its mine and i dont have to give it to you it is not right and most will consider it tantamount to the same thing but im trying to explain that it is a very carefully strategized tactic to give them an out from responsibility

i thought we had separation of church and state where youre not supposed to lecture politics from the pulpit if liberal leaning churches get to advocate for obamacare a law passed only by democrats then the conservative congregations get to denounce it or is religion allowed a pass on political messaging as long as it is in favor of liberal ideas then we have hypocrisy

serious question here why is gold considered more reliable isnt it just like other currency in that its worth comes from our collective decision to assign it worth correct me if wrong but it has no real value of its own besides the ooo pretty factor and some minor use in electronics etc if economies collapse gold is worthless right you cant eat it you cant make shelter with it unless you have a whole freakin lot it is not suitable as a defensive weapon basically youd starve with your pile of gold while those that have shelter food and weapons would be trading with each other to survive so gold paper money pretty much right

gt atheismtheism had nothing to do with the attack how do you know isnt it kind of hypocritical to say this incident certainly had nothing to do with atheism when the sub here is quick to attribute every bad action by a religious believer to his religion it looks as if youre moving the goalpost when theres a claim atheists here dont like they say oh atheism is merely the lack of belief it cant inspire anything on the other hand they dont shy away from antitheistic claims when someone shouts ah this is what religion does to people nobody reponds by saying this doesnt follow from atheism you cant say that in here when youre cultivating a culture of anger hate and stereotyping is it really a surprise if some people start to feel motivated to fight the foe

i think conditions have changed in the us such that we no longer need fear the prospect of a republican resurgence necessitating excessive filibuster protections for democratic minorities going forward we should go nuclear in every regard across the board to stomp down the republicans so the present administration can surge forward with appointments legislation and policy changes that are so urgently needed which will serve to enhance the viability of the administration and the party in terms of hope and change going into the next elections with sufficient more or less relatively progressive democratic super majorities not rotten with blue dog ilk in the house and senate relatively modest and obvious electoral campaign finance and media reforms will become feasible to curtail republican dirty tricks and prevent them from ever again stealing an election to regain majorities a far more viable democracy would emerge such that prospects of a singleparty dictatorship or capture by monopoly corporate fascist interests would also be curtailed by the popular democratic will

christianity has changed drastically from the days of acts and to insist otherwise is to be willfully ignorant people change and cultures change and despite that the bible has stood as a testament to the time christ walked the earth in his interactions with man god gave a multitude of examples for ways to live a hundred different and seemingly contrary ways to be a believer the bible is flexible and it understands human nature while still testifying to the truth the fact that you do not is more telling of you than of scripture or of homosexuals
the gospel is christ and him crucified 1 cor 22
yeah this article was pretty horrible the republican party is extremely splintered and its not all libertarians or theocrats its simply partisan bullshit where repubs r bad dems good when in reality theres good and bad things about both parties
not exactly even in gerrymandered districts there is a lot of disaffection with the tpers even if this means more moderate gopers are elected it will make political change a tad easier but not nearly as amusing
thank you for contributing i agree i think that the more you start to look into the history the more you realize that there is so much you dont know and that there are other possible ways of reading passages

the lefts irrational hatred of walmart is comical to me
sadly his congressional district will keep putting him in office until they nail the box shut
they do that because it works sure people call them out on their bullshit but its mostly the people who already disagree with them their base doesnt listen to anyone who will call them out and would refuse to believe it anyway even if you somehow forced them to hear it they have been rewarded for abusing the system over and over again to the point that we are on the verge of that becoming the system thats a big part of why its so important that they dont get away with it this time this needs to hurt the gop really really badly so badly that they actually think twice about doing it again if were really lucky that will be what finally splits the gop into the several parties that it really is but im not holding my breath

gt how did the democrats let this happen a democracy can never work without good will and integrity the rules are designed for people with good will and integrity if you make the rules unbending enough you lose some of what makes a society a liberal concensusbased democracy it is something the republicans did not something that the democrats let happen
each day i feel the distance between me and any religion increase what a horrible horrible plague on the world it is how anyone can ever defend religion blows my mind comforting for individuals yes binding communities together sure but the insanity the violence the discrimination the backwards thinking the warfare the murder the child rape how anyone can even think to come up with excuses for those things is completely beyond me
gt should reading the bible make one an atheist from the quoted jillette test 126151 and i read the bible cover to cover and i think that anyone who is thinking about maybe being an atheist if you read the bible or the koran or the torah cover to cover i believe will emerge from that as an atheist jillette is referring to a mindset i e people that already have doubts considering leaving the religious faith whilst the article author writes from the position of someone defending the religious faithnot doubting these different approaches or points of view will very likely result in different conclusions if one is reading the bible from the pov of doubt the narratives will provide ample evidence to grow that doubt into nonbelief or lack of belief if the reader has the pov that god is real that the narrative supports this position and that god is supreme then that person will take the same narrative and see a positive towards god confirmation bias is action i found the article to be a bit of a strawman however for those that wish to understand the bible better this short phrase is good advice gt go to the source material examine the scriptural material and its source of the narratives that predated the torahnt concerning god yahweh and the worship of god from whence did yahweh and yahweh worship originate how did this worship change before the torah authors put oral tales to script how did the image of yahweh and yahweh worship evolve between the periods of the authorship of the sources of the torah of the nt

really libraries need to be privatized jesus christ the library is one of the few public institutions of education that we have kept going strong for hundreds of years people like publiclyfunded libraries i cant imagine him getting even hardcore gopers on board with that idea but theres always some wacko libertarian out there that probably thinks its the best idea hes heard all week
we need more of these too many people go to college who should never have been there

when i read the article i noticed that 1 his old premiums were 12 his monthly take home pay 2 his new out of pocket expenses only increase to 26000 if he continues to use the doctor he is seeing now the article makes no mention of 1 why his current insurance company dropped him he was no longer profitable and they saw an opportunity to drop him and blame it on the aca 2 what his new premiums will be they would have mentioned them if they were going to be higher dont you think 3 what his out of pocket expenses would be if he used a doctor that is innetwork to that new policy they would mention that too if it were going to be higher dont you think
im an atheist and a vet i do volunteer work with vets a lot of whom have been homeless one vet told me about how he entered a program at a rescue mission in order to get off the booze and drugs and get back on his feet this particular program offered housing and meals and a little therapy for work every day when the director of the program an ordained minister learned that this vet was an atheist he had the guys bed stripped and his stuff boxed up then he let the vet work the rest of the day and only told him he was back on the street at the end of the day the guy had been in their program working hard for 6 months

im curious about this as well
in many places it was just a bad idea though for example the proposed omahades moineschicago line it would barely travel faster than cars cost more to ride and cost taxpayers hefty amounts to keep running in the future yes the federal government was willing to chip in large amounts but that doesnt mean iowa wants to pay the upkeep costs forever after that we have too much existing infrastructure that needs repairing before we add another new mode in a lot of areas it just doesnt make sense trains can be great for high density areas such as having light rail options in cities and regional rail in our more dense areas but trying to link them in less dense areas like the midwest makes little sense especially when there are existing options such as things like megabus that operate cheaper for the consumer and government faster and without the massive infrastructure investment to push a 3rd mode of travel in addition to vehicle and air plus options like megabus not being fixed in place can much easier adapt to changing demands in the future
i believe a universal minimum income in the us used to be a republican proposal to get rid of cash welfare and food stamps and all the rest i may be wrong about that but i believe in the 60s when they believed the federal government had a purpose and taking care of labor relations was essential to the survival of capitalism they proposed a minimum annual income level these days though no that capitalism has nothing to compete with they dont worry about such trivial things capitalism won that war and there is no american left they have to appease

im sorry but imo the basis for this editorial i e the letter is made up bs the author receives a letter with no proof available like a police report or the author contacting the person to discuss the information further and on the same page is an ad for his book about the same topic imo this story was based on something similar that was true but this author more than likely expanded upon the story and the result is to manipulate us into a knee jerk emotional reaction does he propose a solution no does he do anything to further productive rational discussion on this topic no just look at the other articles hes written never citing anything or providing proof or even saying he spoke with his sources hes a good writer of fiction please dont think that because im sceptical of this author that i some how support violence against woman or something like that completely the opposite but this person appears to be looking to profit on the subject by manipulating you into believing him and that i completely disprove of also if im wrong and this was true then that pastor needs to think harder about whether they put god first or their rules first if you love your rules first your doing it wrong

nope this is not the view of the majority of christians either around the world now or throughout history but it is typical of what are called dispensational premillennialists and they happen to have a pretty strong but weakening presence in the churches of america particularly in the south
here in nc they recently got the invisible man banned from high schools for a year too using extremely similar arguments and language this isnt the invisible man about the guy who becomes invisible due to radiation the banned book was about a poor black man in the south who felt like he was socially invisible trudging through life with those around him using him as labor without ever learning his name heres my thought this is the third story i have heard in as many days about banning books and in all three cases the books were about poverty and disenfranchisement about the disconnect between middle class america and poor america about our class problems in all three cases they claim the books are offensive and pornographic but in all three cases they seem to be very unshocking books i wonder if there is an organization trying to whip up right wing parents to ban books about race and class so we bring up a generation of kids who never address these ideas so that right wing economic policy gets through to them more easily just a thought
one thing thats just kind of flying under the radar is that the gops vision for reduced spending is already enshrined in the democrats senate funding proposals the sequester is the new established baseline and yet its not considered a compromise from the right however the lapse of the bush tax cuts is seen as a huge compromise on their part and that one counts as the basis for new concessions from the dems no matter that the dems are giving them essentially the paul ryan budget its not enough
im going to self censor myself about what i really think about trayvons mama and just say that entire case centered on the agenda of liberals i didnt think i could be pushed any farther away from democrats or liberals up until that point now i despise them

no evidence didnt make his list except maybe indirectly in how the bible really seems like a book of fantasy stories its an odd way of thinking to me its like wishful thinking turned backwards where you dont believe in god because you dont like religion
you got it the wrong way around every single poll has stated that people think gop is the problem guess we will find out for sure when hillary is elected amiright

itchy ears comes to mind the best false hoods are 95 truth and 5 lie
thats because there is a law preventing changes to congresss pay unless it is voted on and even then it can only be implemented after the next congress comes in i think most would agree this is a good thing this is a nonstory designed solely to capitalize on populist outrage
almost a decade old is more than a bit also their
repeal and attempts to alter the existing law are perfectly acceptable and examples of the process at work what the republicans have done and are continuing to do is not acceptableit is extralegal it is an attempt to game the system rather than to legislate it would be wonderful if the gop turned their energy toward correcting actual flaws in the plan perhaps even presenting a better one rather than insisting on this pointless exercise that does nothing but leave us all exhausted and frustrated
yes ive been hearing this bullshit on the radio and tv all week and its infuriating the reason those dont carry over is because they are scams that dont cover shit if you actually get injured but no one seems to be talking about that fact
its a start the fact that it drives the reich wingers nuts is just gravy
and possibly feels guilty that he resides in and makes his living from the highincome class
unfortunately they cant at least for the 3040 odd gerrymandered deep south house seats the gop created that ensure that even with a national democratic sweep theyll remain republican districts to say nothing of the further steps these states have taken to restrict valid voters from exercising their franchise antidemocratic you betcha besides the republican party makes too much money off these extremists to remove them from their group about the only saving grace to this is that the gop moderates they only want to strangle public education social security amp medicare in its crib versus blow its face off with a shotgun have lost control and must now kowtow to these lunatics
so true alan i will not give money to dncc and the rest of the blanket orgs again thank you
i think its a good start and itll be interesting to see how well it works im fairly progressive however i do think that the states should be left to do this not the federal government maybe its the moderate conservative in me or this recent harrumph about obamacare but i just think that if the federal government were to initiate something like this it would be way too messy but with that said i cant wait to see how this pans out
im slowlybutsurely learning to hate my generation i dont wanna i really dont but shitasses like this keep emerging and i cant help but feel like we got it wrong ron paul revolution propaganda successfully converted a sizable portion of millennials into free market cappie shitasses and im afraid that that conversion is permanent for a lot of them it essentially invented a rightwing contingent in the millennial generation

youve done a really great job keeping track of these as someone else mentioned though most of them here are from media matters have you seen these incidents reported elsewhere what was the receptioninterpretation im interested in how slightly less left leaning groups as well as far right leaning groups would interpret this information i havent looked through your 300 examples yet the page is still loading since before i started this comment
that link is worthy of a post in itself
ive read boswells books both of them christianity social tolerance and homosexuality is a bit better but samesex unions in premodern europe is an exercise in wishful thinking im sympathetic i have many of the same wishes but it is whats interesting is that if you read more than the dust jacket he basically admits as much arguing that while these relationships were meant to be celibate they probably didnt all live up to the ideal and that this created a social niche for homosexual men while not being exclusive to them im not sure i like his reading but even his own position at least as i could discern it at the time this was ages ago has a bit more subtlety than omg ancient gay marriages
1 timothy 2 gt1first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all people 2for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life godly and dignified in every way 3this is good and it is pleasing in the sight of god our savior 4who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth 5for there is one god and there is one mediator between god and men the mana christ jesus 6who gave himself as a ransom for all which is the testimony given at the proper time 7for this i was appointed a preacher and an apostle i am telling the truth i am not lying a teacher of the gentiles in faith and truth while i will probably read pipers book i think it is odd to write on something so clearly stated already in holy scripture does god desire all me to be saved yes absolutely he does
baptists evangelicals church of christgod etc all couldnt give two shits what the pope does he doesnt represent them or their views of church doctrine catholics really only make up 25 of our country so it doesnt surprise me that the gop isnt tied to what the pope says
gt many of them could use the free day to take their parents to doctors appointments except the doctor wouldnt be working if the norm was a 4day workweek im all for working less but some of the examples given here are not correct a true 4day workweek would mean a one day longer weekend
sadly they already have the public schools and colleges are simply indoctrination centers for the liberal agenda controlled by socialist teachers unions when i was in first grade my parents bought me nice crayolabrand markers for class the first day of school the teacher took them from me and gave me back cheap roseartstore brand markers with one or two of my original crayola markers that was the first lesson in socialism some students had better supplies than others and that was unfair this practice is done in most public schools ask any parent
as usual theres some idiot making this argument gt i dont believe the government should have to tell me i have to buy any insurance said joshua lucas of arizona a stayathome father of two im 34 years old and i am in great health so i dont feel like i have to have it thats great that you dont feel like you have to have it but if you end up in the er and have no insurance then other people end up paying those bills its not a choice you get to make because it impacts other people directly if you have at least an extra 250000 lying around to cover an emergency then id say you have some room to make that argument but something tells me joshua the stayathome father of two does not have that kind of money saved up for emergencies

three of his four kids are gay what are the odds of that happening my very rough calculation is that it is something like 1 in 2000 but i could be totally wrong whats also interesting is that among the four siblings heterosexuality is the minority orientation
the better question is if we allowed to have personal secrets if we can legally have personal secrets we should then reasonably be able to utilize encryption to protect them the problem is that this isnt how the government feels in the interest of national security

as a fellow pennsylvanian i really do feel like the saying philadelphia and pittsburgh with alabama in between has some truth
to be fair in general voting isnt or shouldnt be just about choosing what is best for yourself
take a moment to watch the above video dont post mean comments this fellow is genuinely scared of his government and hes trying to express it this is what were up against though conservatives have been taught to fear their government taught that their government is some other external entity that is out to take away their rights their money and their freedoms if were to make inroads for the progressive movement were going to need to address and assuage these fears were also going to have to dispel some of the misinformation and misunderstandings people like this have been exposed to this video illustrates the fundamental misunderstandings of how our government operates and who our government consists of
haters gonna hate he hates everyone
maybe its just me but im not really sure why wall street is the headline villain in this story private money managers have always been involved in the investment of public money because it is extremely inefficient to require every municipality to have a team of portfolio managers running the entire fund the real issue seems to be the systematic underfunding and raiding of pension money by the government to fund various projectstax cuts etc
it was shared because of the mentality women are subjected to by pastors by fellow church members by family and coworkers a mentality that lacks compassion and heaps blame and guilt on a victim of violence this story is am extreme example yet it gets to the crux of the epidemic yes an epidemic that is causing trauma m injury and even death to millions of women all over the world even us civilized nations are not immune with violence against women at only slightly lower rates than developed nations according to who the church can do better from the most conservative to the most liberal to work to end this
a good idea but would probably need a constitutional ammendment write to your state government to build support for the idea

gt membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some aspect of the financial services or banking industry real estate development involved with those industries or government contracting some hard working and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as 15m20m before retirement but they are rare gtfolks in the top 0 1 come from many backgrounds but its infrequent to meet one whose wealth wasnt acquired through direct or indirect participation in the financial and banking industries gt most of the serious economic damage the u s is struggling with today was done by the top 0 1 and they benefited greatly from it gt a highly complex set of laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the uppermost reaches of the u s financial system it allows them to protect and increase their wealth and significantly affect the u s political and legislative processes they have real power and real wealth ordinary citizens in the bottom 99 9 are largely not aware of these systems do not understand how they work are unlikely to participate in them and have little likelihood of entering the top 0 5 much less the top 0 1 moreover those at the very top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules so basically investment bankers etc have taken over and are now running and ruining our country they are an existential threat left alone their actions will kill us what do we do about them they have so completely twisted the laws so there seems to be no legal recourse for their actions which suggests the only ways to protect ourselves are extralegal hopefully i am wrong and there are still legal ways to counter them because otherwise the future will be disastrous no matter who wins

a valid question until about a decade ago i would have scoffed and recommended heavy duty tinfoil now now these people have insulated themselves so effectively from the real world that even the threat of bursting that bubble sends them into a panic i think that if their bubble media plays the same game in 2016 as they did this last time and the loony tunes brigade doesnt see their defeat coming or worse yet thinks for sure theyve won again they will snap what that actually means is anyone guess could be a revolt kind of lots of the wingnuts are very well armed having been preparing for that martial law they think obama will declare any day now of course they would fighting the military that they have voted to hurl money at for years which is sort of like banking on your own defeat before you begin try explaining that to one of those idiots and watch them turn purple trying to figure out why they did that

liberals and conservatives should be fighting like hell to reduce the costs of healthcare not merely figuring out ways to make other people pay for it
i feel that so long as all participants are there of their own free will theres nothing wrong with porn if we could move our society past its ridiculous sexual hangups porn would cease to be useful as an avenue of blackmail
i dont think it was mocking obamacare it was mocking everyone else have you ever noticed that when snl did skits with george bush bush was the joke but when they do skits with obama everyone else is the joke and obama is levelheaded
gtthis is because about 10 of catholic doctrine is derived more from apostolic tradition than sacred scripture ive seen this statistic thrown around the sub a few times and i dont quite understand it isnt 100 of catholic doctrine from holy tradition i mean holy tradition is what led to the canonization of the bible so that 90 biblical is just a subgroup of 100 tradition
good points but the previous gop talking points didnt keep kids from seeing pandas at the zoo or shutdown government websites this stuff has a high level of visibility no idea if conservatives will care most of them seem to be low information voters or hot button voters but moderates and swing voters arent walking away with a rosy picture of the gop right now and the last election showed us regardless of the gops unskewing of polls these voters went for obama not romney i guess well see during the midterms how this shit went down with voters
per the article a lot of it was just good luck but im sure reddit isnt going to just believe that
they did a good job i think hopefully one day therell be a dutch revival and itll be reclaimed as a place if worship until then theres worse things it can be used as i suppose
kinda ironic considering obamas support of unions
lol silly usa there are lunatics on the streetcorners but you shouldnt make them majority leader in your government
gt obama thought he could change things but when the curtain was pulled back he either saw something that scared him into backing off or was pushed into becoming a hypocrite or he just said whatever it took to get elected
gt no interviews for any reason ever unless its on fox news
i dont want this to be downvoted to oblivion im being genuine here and trying to start a discussion why is a deficitdebt a bad thing

i have been reading a lot of articles about blackstone just because they have deep pockets doesnt mean they know what they are doing the idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous they cant maintain those properties properly each house has its own set of unique issues because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves the people who cooked up this plan should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes oversight would be easier the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently for all we know the reason they didnt go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual properties remember the part in upton sinclairs book the jungle where the family rents to own a property that is in fact just badly built with a cess pool underneath this is what is happening again all they are creating are slums in neighborhoods destroying the true market value of properties and denying regular folk the opportunity to own a home
i wish religious fundamentalism would be officially regarded as a mental illness
leaving all the other nonsense aside whats up with the representantive from florida saying god placed adam into the garden of eden to work it and that work is not a penalty work is a blessing my bible foo isnt exactly waterproof but im pretty sure that adams penalty was banishment from the garden where the fields had to be worked in order for shit to grow the serpent has to crawl on its belly eve gets painful child birth and adam gets work
nah am worse in reality
it should have absolutely none
if i like your plan you can keep your plan period
like one of those edugames sounds good really
it would be nice to be able to explain more about some of the answers for example im a baptist but baptists in norway are theologically more closely aligned to anapbaptists than southern baptists in america i feel like southern baptists often give us a bad name they seem to completely disregard liberty of conscience among other things that we stand for
what makes you think warren isnt obama v 2 0 thats my main question i was with you in 2008 thinking obama was a more progressive option we were both quite wrong it seems i dont think i trust warren to not be more of the same
unless its bushs election but that wasnt really an election since the supreme court basically awarded him the office
gtbut the ec was not even close 332206 or 6138 gtand even the two elections the gop did win in the last 30 years were both by a single state florida 00 ohio 04 why is why they started a 3 prong attack on the elections suppress the vote voter id laws inaccurate voter rolls falsely disqualifying legitimate voters gerrymandering districts push to divide electoral college votes by winner in each congressional district in blue and purple states but keeping it winner takes all in red states the conservatives arent even pretending anymore that this is nothing more than a bold face attempt to steal elections
my father worked in saudi arabia and became unwell my stepmother had to dress up as a man which my mother said wasnt difficult and drive him to the hospital
simple free market is code for let us do what we want when we want with no oversight or government interference unless we fuck everything up then the government can bail us out
the analysis of the numbers is actually wrong here the 19 741 of prisoners who gave no answer could well be all atheists you can make no assumptions about these is it possible perhaps that they mostly gave no answer because they are atheists
i think the right feels worse about hillary i would think there would actually be less issue with warren
that watermark is your downfall

what the hell is wrong with ending white privilege or employment rights for trans people and by disallow critical assessment of evolution i bet they really mean dont want creationism taught as scientific theory
silent circle is closed source and shouldnt be trusted
as a nonamerican this is getting annoying if half the population of your country is this stupid then why havent the other half tricked them into just going along with them the only thing left to think about americans is that the whole bloody lot are dumb as shit i know you arent really all stupid i have many good intellgent friends who are americans but you guys do need to realize how the entire world is looking at you like a bunch of monkeys with dynamite and matches right now
no not even close capitalism died along time ago when we let large companies write legislation that small companies cant afford or comply with this is why no new banks have opened up in 30 years
you know if my daughter were in a similar situation and i found out a pastor had said something like that to her i cant honestly say how id handle it this makes me pretty angry just to read about it
that was a rather stupid article it criticizes atheism for not being about more than atheism that makes no sense atheists tend to many atheists believe that atheism is not a general world philosophy or political movement its a lack of belief in god
im still getting a blank page with a title header that says success url got it earlier today and just now i got in once a few days ago and experian said my address wasnt my address and couldnt confirm my identity i was at work and didnt have time to call so i closed out havent been able to get back in since
transhumanism is a morally questionable set of ideas at best but this article is put forward by a few crazies from backwoods usa
the government is not a charity
if he has a gun against an innocent persons head he deserved to be shot yes he might be troubled he might have a rough past he might have just fallen in with the wrong crowd but in the end he is the one who decided to pull the gun on somebody it is his responsibility he has nobody else to blame but his own self i believe in forgiveness and second chances and i hope this young man turns his life around but he has nobody but himself to blame for where he is
garfunkel and oates are amazing sex with ducks is another fantastic takedown of religious stupidity
part of me thinks obamacare was designed to fail leaving single payer as the option to save the day the people that engineered it just cant be that stupid can they it has to be a conspiracy
something like a cvd type 3d printer
because theyre following the lead either directly or indirectly of fox news and the religious right theyre told that health insurance is evil and theyre not in the habit of questioning what theyre told by those they consider to be reliable sources though honestly this is sort of a chickenandegg situation
well at least this proves hes a little more pragmatic than his father not that thats saying much
its already on the books in new york but the democratic amp republican politicians think itd be better to give the billions of dollars back every year rather than fully funding our needed social programs
the government has no rights the government at least as the constitution spells out only has powers granted by the electorate it has no right to any of those powers
wow they are so polite and suspiciously similar i agree sen warren has a nice ring to it and she will get a hell of a lot more done in congress than the white house you make a good and intelligent case one ive had in the back of my mind her value as a senator is irreplaceable and i agree because i like that as senator she has the ability to focus all of her energy on particular key issues i read this article and am in agreement i think the country would be better off with her as a senator i have thought the same thing i think she is in the right place at the right time i agree i didnt think i would agree with you but you made a great case keeping her in the legislature is invaluable
i wouldnt say its terrorism but it is extortion and its not democracy recall congress
this would easily go 3000 upvotes outside of this sub
i think similar results were reported a few months ago but either way this makes sense the biggest and most well funded and supported opposition to evolution in schools comes not from young earth creationism but from intelligent design
you will be abused heh heh
the problem is actually much worse unemployment among young people is at a level that would have been considered a crisis on par with the depression in 1950 fixes are not as easy as raising the minimum though we have a much broader work force almost all women work outside the home which was less the case in 1950 and much less demand for labor do to automation and computers its not just factory jobs either we have tons of software solutions that render human labor far less necessary heck even the humble voice mail is a job killer so while raising the minimum wage and even indexing it is fair its not going to help very much and might even speed up automation since robotics are getting better by the day there is an ethical solution social credit pay everyone a base wage combined with a distributive economic system changing the system to incentivize distribution within the middle tier but they are politically difficult to get into play also both require big changes a much smaller military trade controls and deep limits to immigration which have other issues and note the current solution of social democracy doesnt work well europe has it and also has heavy youth unemployment and low birth rates its not as bad as actual marxism 100 fail by volume but it doesnt seem to resolve the problem its slows the bleeding but it doesnt heal the body i think and i do not know that the above might work if it doesnt well as aaron cleary puts it enjoy the decline
i actually dont care about google comment i would prefer if they fix their broken player stuff like debuffering a video because i went back in the video is frustrating
this message needs to get out more as it sits the propaganda of the lamestream media has been successfully painting the right as angry white people as opposed to the soccer moms of the left
lol seriously i love these old fat out of shape tough guys that you can just look at and tell they have never been through anything real he would probably bitch up if you backhanded him you probably wouldnt even have to close your hands to get him to fold up like origami
first comment to the article sums it up pretty well andrew craig hendrix college im coming over to your house to eat your food sleep on your couch and watch your tv whether you like it or not but dont you dare try to stop me that would be initiation of force what a bunch of patently ridiculous nonsense if you want to make some psuedomarxist case against the existence of private property fine but dont set yourself up as attacking libertarianism in doing so youre attacking the entirety of western civilization and the laws and mores of the vast majority of the world trespassing is not a uniquely libertarian concept
im surprised to see that anger is even considered a rationale for atheism is this how theists view atheists as angry and hateful towards their gods
obama has and always was not qualified not progressive not liberal and not going to be a good president itll be a long long time if ever will we see somebody liberal or progressive in the whitehouse
gt the last time someone made more than they took was the dawn of civilization thats probably not fair though i agree with the rest of your point and the sentiment entirely quantified capitalistically contributors like salk curie whitney gutenburg and im sure many others had more of a positive impact on everything than they could have possibly takenconsumed in their time
him and all the other tea party members are a subsidiary of the koch brothers
they still use coca leaves in it i think without the cocaine
what in the howdy fuck is this
let me get this straight gtcopes challenge pdf states that the teaching of evolution amounts to an excessive government entanglement with religion and violates the rights of christian parents has anyone told them the pope accepts evolution as a scientifically valid theory has anyone told them it isnt just this pope but john paul ii as well are they suggesting that catholics should ignore the pope are they suggesting that catholics who follow the pope are not good christians are they suggesting the current pope and his predecessor are not good christians
when you destroy relationships for a team or when you neglect your families friends and neighbors for the teamyou waste the day are you really this crazy i think i speak for a lot of people when i say most of the games i watch are with friends family and yes even neighbors we invite eachother over and enjoy the day together your mind is extremely clouded and irrational
it can contribute to the national debt if congress ever pays back over 1 6 trillion it has pilfered from the trust fund that payback would then show up on the current debt account
if he came back most of the populous wouldnt believe it was him even if he said so himself because we are such a different people from 2000 years ago our core values are different racism gay rights politics rich vs poor more religions than anyone can count we have been divided in so many big ways that everyone has huge opinions on
ill go back to supporting gay marriage after i finish pandering to wyoming troglodytes for votes
at the same time dont forget the party who is living hood rich by taking out as many credit cards as possible and maxing them both parties are retarded

scumbags as with all religions this one will die one day my only regret is that i will likely not be alive to see that day
support for legalizing has risen significantly in the last three years and the 2010 election was problematic because younger people who are more likely to vote for marijuana legalization tend to only vote during the federal elections cycle there may have been other problems with it but the two i mentioned were probably the most prominent issues
just finished listening it was pretty interesting i love keller although i have to say he didnt push hard enough on what sounded a bit like a kind of slippery sophistry coming from epstein appealing to beauty in trying to define what beauty is assuming theres a place where were going etc it seemed like he did this the whole time
funny how the private sector and the wealthy are literally the goose that lays the golden egg the source of revenue for all the wonderful social programs that the left deems so indispensable for a humane society and yet the left seems utterly impervious if not downright hostile to the health and wellbeing of said goose ive said it before and ill say it again the most effective social program ever devised is a paying job in the private sector it costs taxpayers nothing and it produces tax revenue for govt private enterprise has lifted literally hundreds of millions of chinese and indians out of poverty just in the last 25 years think what it could do in america if it werent drowning in tax and regulatory overkill
on the plus side though maybe this will drastically reduce the number of people who comment on youtube
i am just hoping he will get center to right catholics to think
i just moved out of pa to ny and i have never been happier ive lived in pa my whole life and i cant believe how crazy it is getting
as minority populations grow in texas republicans solidify their position as the anti minority party they really dont think about the long term do they
virginia is a deep south state the fact that the governor lt governor and both state senators are all democrats well that should definitely say something right
no its the holy spirit teaching you having the bible is a big plus gt john 14 15 if ye love me keep my commandments 16 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever 17 even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
people have confirmation bias i doubt too many people will rush to embrace the change of view with new information however if this law succeeds in twenty years or fewer it will be like social security and medicarevery difficult to touch without severe backlash and almost impossible to abolish
with both sides assuming that the other is too ignorant to understand anything that is happening in the world theres no potential for constructive discourse people who complain about biased media are forgetting that this is one of its hallmarks and allowing yourself to get caught up in this is what drives their ratings if you know your shit either run for office or support a candidate who does
i wish the purge was a thing i really really do
elid why does washington want boeing there if they pay no taxes the people they employ
i havent read zerohedge in years but i remember they promised apocalyptic market crashes that shouldve happened years ago
the science vs religion thing kills me you believe in religion and accept scientific reasoning they are not mutually exclusive and have varying degrees of belief and acceptance i almost lost a friend a couple years ago after a day of drinking ending up in a discussion on god she accused me of choosing to believe in science and said hopefully just arguing the other side that she thinks evolution is bullshit we are still good friends but hopefully will never discuss god again
how do you look reasonable when you refuse to vote on a bill the senate submitted on friday that would have averted shutdown
yes i would agree their faith is just as earnest as ours but like the article said the theology of mormonism is very different from main stream christianity and is cleverly worded on the surface to look alike but deep down in the specifics mormonism and most main line christian church theology is very different so i wouldnt call it exclusivity if the president of the lds church said himself that he wants christians outside of the lds to come and change their jesus i dont think that will help but maybe it will love to keep talking about it with you
the shutdown isnt keeping them from going bankrupt that will happen around oct 17th at current spending
awesome scene but i think it would be much better if she skipped the i believe in science and evolution part and went straight into the i cannot get behind a supreme being who science isnt abelief and although some christians do deny science it is not nearly as common as using religion to justify horrible things and condemn people for not being christian
im not sure whats worse the policies that have kept the economy stifled for so long or the unwavering support of those policies by those who are being hurt the most by them
sounds like the democrats too
which begs the question if any of their republican friends asked their help in undermining the web site i wouldnt put it past the gop theyve done everything else
i posted about this too here are my thoughts its being portrayed as some sort of gaff by rand paul but i dont think thats what happened at all mcconnell straight up tells paul that hes wired up so i think that everything rand paul says was meant to be heard what do you guys think am i giving them too much benefit of the doubt does it sound like theyre ready to cave or do you think theyre speaking of pulling back to a delay of the individual mandate from the starting point of defunding
hey im all for this but damn when i read the headline i thought they were going to expand medicare to cover everyone and get rid of the convoluted aca stuff
shes batshit crazy and has already reversed her position sourcewral on the reversal source on batshit crazy is widely held opinion in nc
i agree with that now and i agreed with it when i was an atheist
why in the ever loving fuck is this formatted the way it is just link the clip man
using batkid to divert attention from the black eye that was the obamacare roll out low
what the hell happened here
i heard you like websites
im always shocked that people care about this of all things during every christmas season what a checkout person says to me has absolutely zero to do with how jolly my christmas is and it makes me wonder about those for whom its an issue edit grammar
the blame obviously goes to rand paul but it is weird that his book editor and the washington post editor didnt catch the plagiarism isnt that a pretty big part of what an editor is
people with negative personal history will take advantage of the easy fix of saying they found religion
it was always burning since the worlds been turning
this notice that muslims in developed countries dont do this kind of stuff with nearly as much frequency muslims in the third world are violent and intolerant bigots much like you know everyone else people tend to make false causal relationships between islam and violence when what they should be looking at is poverty and violence
im pretty sure that no one takes that guy seriously
to be fair these are two businesses at microsoft which are hemorrhaging money while they may have other ancillary benefits i think it is fair for a company to look at parts of its business which are in the red and decide to cut its losses that being said i think selling the xbox business would be a mistake
i understand their strategy a painful government shutdown puts a ton of pressure on boehner if it is made less painful then boehner could keep the stalemate up even longer
schools where i live alabama let out hell even my college let out
i cut down on this by not friending six thousand people and periodically deleting people i havent had any interaction with in over six months not that their shit isnt broken and needs work done but in the meantime you can reduce some of the bullshit
not that i have a problem with the message but al sharpton isnt the sort of person i want fighting my fights
as a conservative morality and economics dont and shouldnt mix
i think the article is too vague and not specific enough social programs are and have been widely available i dont believe the lack of programs are to blame i also dont think poverty is to blame because children poor children from poverty areas do excel it is the breakdown of social values and the family support unit children from homes that promote education can and do succeed we have a cultural problem with education we expect everyone to be high achievers and work white collar jobs making very high wages i like what mike rowe promotes that college isnt for everyone and that you can succeed without a college education college isnt for everyone people with less than a high school education can build a solid life please dont misunderstand social programs are important but social programs have failed to universally improve the areas the article addresses we need a new not a tired old strategy again social programs are important and needed but social programs will not solve the problems with education one footnote i think teachers unions get a bad reputation because they are set up to protect and advantage labor over the education of students that fact cannot be denied their first mission is to promote the welfare of the teacher when they protect bad teachers they get but dont deserve the reputation they get i cringe when i see a teachers union spokesperson talk about how high quality education is their number one goal when everyone knows the number one goal is to enhance the welfare of the union members people can spin the goals of teachers unions with talking points all day they need to be genuine even the children know the unions are disingenuous at times
i read that in joey mousepads voice except saying intragnisent
whats great about this is obama is really calling him to the mat if a vote were called and didnt pass it would legitimize the gop bs if it passes boehner is finished obama is basically telling boehner to bet his career love it
bull fucking shit these police to many police are out of control there are serious dangerous problems in this in every way possible
to be honest as a biracial person black dad white mom living in the midwest ive never encountered any bigotry unique to my circumstance most of the time im treated just like any other person but when i do encounter racism im just treated like any other black person never met a racist with a special brand of racism just for me of course thats not to say that they dont consider the origins of my conception and are repulsed by the thought
as a current mainer i want to point out that angus is usually the most calm composed wellspoken person when i read what he apparently said i was shocked i had to read it again because i didnt believe that it was him who said it ive never seen him say anything that passionate it was touching
what were also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy obama 2013 reminds me of shovelready was not as shovelready as we expected obama 2011 this is why many of us railed against him from the beginning he was and remains completely out of his league from a basic knowledge and experience perspective he is not bright enough not experienced enough not intelligent enough and certainly not humble enough to understand and respect what he and his cohorts do not know the administration as a whole acts like the classic firstyear grad students who have this sudden epiphany about the utter simplicity of a solution to a longstanding problem that many others have attempted and failed to fix but it turns out that grad student more often than not simply doesnt have enough experience andor understanding of the true nature of the problem to even begin to propose a solution and concludes with nothing but a mess on the whiteboard i find as a conservative by nature that i tend to hold back on broad promises boastful solutions and glamorous statements about fixing things until i have had time to sit and brood and analyze and assess and seek guidance and input from others that has served me well in not looking like an asshole obama might want to try that some time

i like how everyone seem to whine about how horrible it is that apple may have to adapt to the real world while nobody seem to realize the 3 5 mm audiojack is huge and useless without being standardized via law
part of me thinks that reducing this stock of ivory will increase prices they should sell it and use the money to better equip anti poaching agencies but then this would probably lead to much more poaching by corruption
they would probably drop through the floor if men werent permitted to drive instead
as someone else from albany id say that you havent been paying attention to the backlash thats started people are fed up with cuomo and hes polling in the toilet if republicans can come up with a decent candidate cuomo wont get reelected

yeah iam voting chris christie over clinton he has fresh ideas when it comes to education and he has this tell it straight persona dislikes the tea party too
i wonder what rob portman would say about that
gtthe first amendment in the bill of rights is in direct opposition to the first commandment of the bible even though i knew the first commandment and first amendment i had never realized this this is an awesome argument
i have said and will continue to say that she would be perfect for the position of president of the world bank jim yong kims term is up in 2017 and if the democrats win the presidency in 2016 she has to be in consideration senator warren has a deep knowledge of the banking system and the effects of loans on people in economic need she has to be in consideration and i think she could do a tremendous amount of good worldwide in that position
this is such an excellent little sermon thanks for posting it the reformation really isnt something to boast about at least not yet and its far from over if we dont think our institutional disunity is a scandal and threatening to our salvation then weve missed a large part of what jesus is about
i totally applaud the sentiment behind this but im very confused by the economics behind it why is it a good idea for say a toothbrush or a small childs toy to be manufactured in taiwan shipped to a canadian distribution centre trucked to walmart bought by me packed into a small box and then flown to afghanistan it doesnt alleviate structural poverty in afghanistan it depresses any local market in small consumer goods its a hugely inefficient way of distributing things and it assumes that i a rich western consumer am the best person to decide what goods a child in afghanistan really needs if the point is to provide goods why not buy in bulk or better yet invest in long term infrastructure and health improvements if you really want to make a difference in the developing world i recommend following the advice of givewell org and donating directly to malarial treatment
the best comment is the out of place 911was an inside job
she said she hasnt seen republicans this happy in years and they are irate that the president could do this to our government you need some sort of fancy red and blue 3d glasses to simultaneously process both signals into one coherent one i really dont know how they do it
people who dont understand this are idiots you cant claim your product can diagnosis cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease unless it has been proven in clinical trials and approved for said use by the fda if you go through said process then your product is legally a drug and you can claim it does the things it is approved to treat if you arent willing to go through this process then you are making bullshit claims and you need to hire a marketing team that doesnt have its head up its own rear
amazing i remember when i was still just an idea its great to see how far its come and done
while the amount of respect i have for mark driscolls teaching is lets call it small for the sake of charity i think we should treat his followers a little more kindly rebuke is a lot more effective if it isnt done from a place of contempt
now who is going to have the balls to ask the wh about it
having spent hours in stopped traffic on routes that are 90 miles apart and watching so many cars with a single rider in them i think that we need to stretch ourselves a little and devise rail that is going to be faster and better than cars i think that we need to tip our hats to the concept that buses are not the same experience as a car or a train they are usually the equivalent of steerage because they are limited in size and thus cant offer amenities like snacks or the ability to stretch your legs we need to try and understand the costs in a more equal manner is the cost of building maintaining and patrolling our highways built in to any cost comparison when rail is deemed more expensive or are the costs just less visible to cars because youre only thinking about the cost of gas to fill your tank using federal reimbursement rates the cost for a 90mile car trip would be 50 oneway that is the estimated cost of gas plus depreciation now assume that tolls are a fair approximation of the cost of maintenance of the highway tolls can be 520 per car for the same trip including things like bridges i just priced a 90mile route and was quoted 21 by amtrak that means for up to about 3 people rail is more costeffective on its face however that does neglect the cost to get tofrom the stations it is at least competitive for a party of 2 the main problem is that the duration of the trip is over 3 hours but does it have to be why cant the train go 100 mph that would cut travel down to a competitive level
i got one of these this morning the kid and mother handed it to me with about five words spoken were distributing these to everyone was the extend of the conversation they werent at all interested in discussing anything weird
another facet of this ridiculous case is that it would set precedent to allow discrimination of customers businesses owned by muslims could refuse service to jews vise versa etc
gtafter totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states it becomes apparent that even a below average democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage the author said no wonder president barack obama was so confident of victory in 2012 for he knew the game was practically over before it began if this is widely known should we not conclude that any pollster who predicted a romney landslide must have been quite illinformed and perhaps even criminally incompetent
increase the sample size to the last twenty five terms

if im not mistaken members of congress have constitutional immunity for things donesaid on the floor of congress or while in the exercise of their official duties so never they can say whatever they like but would have to actually break a specific law in order to be arrested

the question is why do men need wives its a serious question
its the same reason brave new world is a dystopia a world without suffering is one without freedom without thought without life its boring it would be like the trillion other dead planets in the universe
my real problem with this is that the majority of those 144 werent really voting to send the us into default only a total moron would do such a thing and yes there were probably a few of those the rest just recognised that the vote would pass with or without them and so had the freedom to vote against thereby maintaining their ideological purity at no cost to the nation or consequences for themselves they can parade this in front of the same assclowns who voted for them the first time around and ensure their reelection to carry on representing their gerrymandered district next time as a demonstration of both flatout cynicism and the dysfunction inherent in the us political system it couldnt really be much more perfect
on a side note today i learnt psalm 137 mentioned in this article inspired by the rivers of babylon by boney m which was one of my favorite records many years ago

i think kennedy would have defended bushs iraq invasion he escalated eisenhowers advisors to vietnam if he was willing to send men to die to fight communism i can easily see him supporting troops going to afghanistan and iraq assuming he believed the intelligence provided to the un by colin powell
i really dont get his thinking with this he either thought this was actually true which means hes an utter moron or he knows it was a huge lie which means hes a complete piece of shit either way he looks bad eventually for saying this once the truth comes out so im not sure what his end game was here

agreed theres no reason to put people behind bars unless theyre a threat to society if theyve got a drug problem our tax dollars would be much better spent on their treatment rather than years behind bars where they cost us money rather than contribute tax dollars
gt either the judges are intentionally incompetent or corrupt or both last line of the article gt lodsys can be sure it will continue to draw judge gilstrap as long as it files its cases in marshall texas the other judge who considers patent cases filed there is us district judge leonard davis but since judge davis son william bo davis is lodsys lawyer the companys cases will all be redirected to gilstrap gt

or things not to say in prison my friend just got out of federal prison and he likes this show he says the petty bureaucratic and stupid interpersonal fuckups are welldone overblown and fictionalized but well done and that she stands out too much by saying shit like this
i think that aspect of the verse lacks punch because 1 ordinary people make great sacrifices all the time 2 god can just snap his fingers and do or undo anything so if his pie is burning its hard to feel sorry for him 3 if we start talking about the trinity in this context our brains will melt so i think its hard to get hopped up on this verse it reminds me of cases where a christian has announced that christs sacrifice was the greatest possible because crucifixion is the worst thing possible that can happen to anyone i can name a few things that i would gladly submit to crucifixion in order to avoid hint mary endured one of those tldr adam is trying to start a circle jerk
yeah that 5 million number seemed wrong ca has about 7 million uninsured so 5 million would be a crazy portion for the first day the guy says that he misinterpreted when someone else told him 5 million im guessing someone told him 5 million page views and he didnt know the difference between page views and unique visitors

this is an extraordinarily serious moment one that deserves not to get lost in our pop culture milieu look look at what we have leading us whom why does wall street support obama is their collective compensation increasing or decreasing are they at risk of being unable to feed a hungry infant look at massive health insurance companies their premiums doubling while those in government squabble about website coding are they making more or less filthy lucre are their executives at risk of being unable to feed a hungry child oil companies same and no risk so while millions of working poor with the emphasis on working as in why should they be poor in a rich country while working before we even get to those unable to find work there will be real fear afoot hunger deprivation for untold millions of children their families while others ignore their plight if obama was the leftist or liberal he is accused of being this could never happen yet as per the reportage it is about to happen what a disgrace in a wealthy country that the fat that gets cut takes the food out of the mouths of children

i was very proud to be in mr michauds congressional district during undergrad and im very much looking forward to having him as governor of maine when he was my congressman i didnt even know about his sexual orientation it never even occurred to me to look into it why because hes a leader i want him to be a good leader i dont need him to be a good lover i dont need him to be someone whos into the same things in the bedroom that i am i dont care if he shares my sexual preferences or not i genuinely do not care i want him to be good at his job and to advocate for a legislative platform that would benefit his constituents period anything else is a distraction from his record so far i know that hell make an outstanding governor certainly better than that clown angus king
i dont think the pope is invoking his religious beliefs in making his statements hes simply stating the obvious the banks and wall st own amp contol our goverment and if your really honest with yourself youll realize they own our lives as well what were payed what hours well work ect ect look at the black friday videos thats not christmas shopping those are people desperate for a little piece of the old american dream cheap products from our new masters in china

agreed im glad dems didnt cave in further as well but this shit is how the overton window keeps shifting reps keep making extreme demands so much so that status quo policies start to seem like democrat victories while we may have averted disaster democrats won nothing on policy here

because that gives the minority party an even bigger incentive to force budget bills to fail

gtcontrary to the teachings of some faiths atheists can express love atheists love their spouses and children they experience awe and wonder they appreciate beauty they enjoy literature and poetry atheists who are materialists are not dry machines of logic devoid of compassion they simply believe all the wonder in life is part of how the natural universe works i wish he would have added that saying these things are just god working through the atheists is sanctimonious and rude
they are in the banking industry it goes without saying
subcontracting and temp agencies are kill wages in this country the company could pay more if it was not paying several layers of management in other companies instead of the end worker
humans are a social animal social animals function primarily as groups rather than as individuals therefore any ideology that puts the individual first is not only an aberration in terms of future survival of the group and ultimately the species but it is logically incorrect as well
stossel is a piece of rancid cat shyte heres a good rule of thumb for what should be privatized and what shouldnt if you want to control the outcome of a given situation then socialization is the way to go the whole raison detre for private enterprise is to make money not provide whatever outcome you desire lets use the example of a sewage system the outcome you want is basic sanitation for obvious reasons now you can give that job to government where the entire enterprise is set up to provide the service without having to make a profit if you give that job to private business their entire purpose is to make money making money takes precedence over providing the service one of the primary ways to make money for the private enterprise is to not provide the service so when the outcome matters its best to pool our resources as a society and bring down the price of the outcome we desire stossel and other conservatives ignorereject this simple concept in the vague hopes that someone will be able to take more money from the american taxpayer than the government would in taxes to provide the service in the mistaken belief that privitazation generates more economic growth which even if true does not negate that if privatization works so great where are the all too obvious examples halliburton isnt exactly a poster child for spending taxpayer dollars efficiently is it the guys who lost their radioactive fracking waste along a texas highway the ones who said theres no reason to hold down costs because theyre all passed onto taxpayers

the tea party is the greatest gift to long term liberal wins ever
i have been listening to the proceedings as much as i can both sides have problems but the republicams have one glaring issue that nobody is pointing out they are not coming up with new arguments rather they are taking every argument made by the democrats and using the same words to accuse back across the aisle its a childish schoolyard game of i know you are but what am i one example it was said the republicans were holding the government hostage today i heard a republican say democrats were holding jobs hostage this all seems to me to be a highly engineered scheme by a faction to wreck havoc on the federal government the tea party types want an anarchy and that is what they are on their way to creating i would hope if this petition is our only way out from under boehners gavel that the 7 day option applies to this situation rather than the 30 day version
are they always that wide ours are pretty narrow about half the width id say
gop grand plan sabotage or just straight up break the system then bitch about how its broken
the doctor who wrote this article provides several heartbreaking examples of her past patients that show the emergency room solution is no solution at all fta gt the emergency medical treatment and labor act emtala which states that hospitals with emergency rooms have to accept and stabilize patients who are in labor or who have an acute medical condition that threatens life or limb that word stabilize is key hospital ers dont have to treat you they just have to patch you up to the point where youre not actively dying also hospitals charge for er care and usually send patients to collections when they cannot pay the disregard of the poor by the likes of cruz is shameful it is past time for a universal system
okay i want to get back to reading this man im feeling so spiritually apathetic lately but back when i was reading the great divorce screwtape letters and mere christianity i didnt feel like this is there some online resource anyone could recommend or even just a complete list of his works
who gets the money and how do you determine when they dont get anymore money
ugh i hate how they act like they care about veterans day
i love the idea but no one in dc would ever let this happen this would be a direct tax on everyone that owns them as well as their own money machine portfolios
this is pretty much exactly how a lot of liberals feel and you wont find very many conservatives in america who agree with your viewpoint obama has stated before he was president that he would love to have a single payer system what you describe is obamas ideal solution for healthcare he didnt bother trying for single payer because he knew it would most likely die theres also an argument to be made that having single payer out of nowhere would be too drastic the aca acts as sort of a transition phase to smooth things out
op you should post this to rmilitaryatheists

i wonder what happens if you take a group of armed men in a foreign country and then tell them that a youre not getting paid and b no you cant leave
tell that to the executive branch who have violated established law by continually making alterations and exempting people from it
you must know the opposition will continue to push and push and will certainly go right up to the point where he has no choice but to stop them everybody has a limit somewhere
walker turned in the aide that had embezzled which actually prompted the investigation into that issue and was not charged with anything related to the aide that sent campaignrelated emails while on the job after extensive investigations into both issues the authors failure to look into these issues and subsequent noise about ethical clouds is shoddy the only reason there are ethical clouds is because of journalists who restate these unwarranted allegations to the casual news reader if walker violated some campaign law rest assured that it will come to light because he has polarized his constituency and will be subjected to investigations for any allegations of scandal this being the third such investigation that i am aware of in his few years in office but lets not implicate him in two prior scandals that he was investigated for and cleared of in order to paint him with the guilty brush before this investigation is concluded
id attribute this to popular media i used to really enjoy watching ghosthunters and the like on tv i could imagine a lot of this psychic stuff getting popular because of that
gtthey can display it any way they want they can have one of their art classes make a drawing of it and put it up he said they could have some of the ptos or the ptas get out there and be involved in it theres a million ways to do this that wont cost them a penny gtthe proposal includes no plan for enforcement call me cynical but the fact that it has no plan for enforcement or penalties for noncompliance makes me think this is a rather obvious political ploy also seeing as it is left to local schools to come up with a way to accomplish this it would appear that they would be left to deal with any litigation and the resulting expenses at the local level if this bill does pass litigation is almost certain to follow and recent decisions make me think that it will be determined to be unconstitutional encouraging public schools to waste valuable education money on frivolous lawsuits strikes me as terribly irresponsible government
the first native american for president hmmm
on the one hand yes the dems have done it in ma and il on the other hand the general slope of the board is definitely in the gops favour right now
wow hannity if you were to replace atheist with gay in that conversation fox would have been over run by civil rights activist now i am not directly relating the two but i do think that in some situations the pressure from the family and community will cause some to keep their secret to themselves and not speak up about it
when scientists make models predicting warming and basically every single model is wrong how can you say you are more certain warming is caused by humans regardless of whether the warming is actually caused by humans if your models are wrong how are you more certain
its weird that conservatives will believe this shit like you dont need to conduct experiments or have access to classified material or process raw data the bill is public you can read it it is long though and find where it is in the bill if its there site the page it is on but it isnt because there are only voluntary visits
ok what is this common core thing and why is it called common core and why is it all you hear when talking about education recently ive never heard of it before lately
i agree with you the stronger the middle class the better for our economy the democrats support the middle class and help the lower class with food and shelter the republican support of corporations and the rich help only a select few
i once was a young earth creationist because that is what i thought was the most literal understanding of the bible struggling with the text for many years i eventually changed my opinion upon reading genesis unbound by john sailhamer through this book i came to acknowledge that the meaning of genesis 1 is not as clear as i once gathered therefore i am now a respecter of many views though holding to a form of old earth creationism myself
agreed bet your own fucking paycheck boehner
you can be angry at the people who promote something im not angry with theism thats too nebulous but i am angry at the westburough baptist church but there is a difference between being angry and being effective anger can motivate you to get something done

how would they all my online accts are password protected and i have already talked to a friend about the whole hey if i die you need to go on these websites and contact these people they would want to know
gt well one of the reasons some americans feel theyre being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes which are low compared to other modern countries and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries a lot of our health care costs higher education costs admissions and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things lo and behold we end up being a relatively hightax country ive been saying this for years and it never seems to sink in to fairly compare taxes in the u s with other countries you have to add in the costs of healthcare and college corporations corrupting the tax code is a different discussion the cost of healthcare in america is also a different discussion healthcare is more expensive here because we pay geometrically more for the same services
the problem i have with lists like this is that their scope is so limited they target christian biblical literalism as the reason for rejecting all religions there is nothing mentioned about the claims being unproven just objections that are straw men for any sophisticated believer it almost seems like any rigorous non literal interpretation of scripture could easily pull this kind of atheist back into the fold
conservative viewpoints should be a natural response to a country with financial problems like we have now unfortunately the current crop of republicans in office very often look like ignorant bible thumpers not saying there arent exceptions but this is how the republican party is often preceived which scares the hell out of a lot of people especially the younger ones like myself
to that pastor youre completely right we have better things to do than debate what goes on between two adults in their bedroom so mind your own fucking business and stop opposing allowing secular legal marriages between two consenting adults
yep he just lost did he really just respond to hey we can help kids with cancer by saying look i have people at nellis sitting at home and what is stuck in his throat jesus turn your head from the mic before coughing up a lung anyway i thought obamas schtick was that he is a pragmatic not an absolutist leader the conditions you find yourself in are that the government is shut down you have the option of at least working with republicans to get the nih going again why not do it you worked with republicans to keep the military funded why cant you do the same for the nih and please oh please stop with the enough is enough and talk about reckless and so on such statements add zero value and inhibit cooperation
they are prepping her for the next election a few days ago something was posted regarding her husband bill clinton saying that people should be able to keep their plan if they want to now i think that this is a clear tactic used to try and separate hillary from the obama administration without them saying she is against them now the trick is that she is not really against him rather she is being the typical dem and abandoning ship to benefit herself im calling it right now there will be a rather subtle divide between her and the obama admin his declining approval rating is cancerous to her campaign and she is going to start making distance
this raised my blood pressure a considerable degree
imo this website debacle is a distraction eventually the site will be fixed and we will all be forced to do business with an insurance company of all types of companies these are my least favorite to deal with
doing their best to overwhelm and corrupt local elections
i needed a good laugh today thank you
in hell along with the other false gods
typical liberal race baiting sad sad times we live in ive been called a racist just because i dont agree with what obama is doing i dont care if he is black white orange or any color that the human eye can see
im unfortunately ignorant if methodist vows but does it say in the rules that you cant marry a homosexual couple while i disagree with the spirit of these events if he knowingly did it against the rules there are going to be consequences just like a bishop being excommunicated for ordaining a woman priest
his favorite color is coca cola he clearly knows whats up
can you block all those hashtags i get more aggravated by those than i should
apparently they forgot about how much this helped clinton short memories when you run on antigovernment and fuck it all up people take you at your word since the idiots cant figure out why they get blamed instead of dems
why would you buy this and what would you do with it
the people at ifixit must be getting a bit miffed that someone has already done their job for them
i said it when he was elected the first time barack obama will be remembered eventually as the worst president in american history
this person has an interesting view of what traditional means
i was happy to see mccain come out and rip him on that comparison
this is definitely a problem with blogging style journalism they likely dont go through editors before hitting the screen because on nearly every article these days these are the views of such and such and not our company to protect them because they dont check their work
its hard to come up with a concise reason why the us is as loony as it appears to be its like a combination of willing ignorance lack of leadership and the glorification of selling people out for your own profit there are other reasons too they are just escaping my train of thought for the moment that all said despite all the gloom and doom that every talking head is trying to earn a buck from consider that things have been worse people have been rounded up dressed in attractive uniforms armed with firearms and then marched off to a field in northern france to be ground into mulch people have dropped in droves from the flu there has been wholesale eradication of people solely because they prayed to the same god but in a different way amongst all that we collectively still found time to rip people off poison and rape them that is just the 20th century what we have now is trivial by comparison
i mean i hate sarah palin as much as the next right thinking person but i think you nailed it
this is why i love adam4ds stuff great comics d

reddit should just ban every mod and start again that would be fun
my friend and i are going to attend a rodeo with one of us wearing an obama mask and one of us wearing a tshirt pointing saying im with stupid
why did they stay here until the 1980s when the rates started dropping when you make that much money enough to be in an 80 tax rate you live wherever the hell you want to and the tax rate is not that much of a concern
what they dont tell you in this article is that all of the sweatshop labor that goes into producing these uniforms is carried out by a company called unicor that pays convicts pennies an hour to do work that should be done by all of the hard working american citizens that cant find jobs right now there isnt any way to make money in prison unless you work for them and when they feed you bullshit you have to be able to get money on your books to survive this is new world slave labor at its finest
conservatives have been making a concerted effort to turn r politics more red for as long as its been a subreddit the recent mod actions are part of that they just cant stand there being a liberal forum on the internet despite having hundreds of their own right wing shitholes to stink up theyve set their sights on this one
its a shame that the author perpetuates the myth of mother teresa but otherwise a good article
this story makes no mention of the 2013 election and only once mentions hassan rouhani i mean wtf its not like there is only side on a negotiation table its like when conservatives credit ronald reagan with the end the cold war without a mention of mikhail gorbachevs reforms perestroika and glasnost i think having a more moderate leader in iran is a bigger reason for progress with them then anything any secretary could do
i love how the reasoning for why it should be illegal is because early use in kids makes them more susceptible to drug abuse later the law would clearly state the the persons would need to be 21 to buy it just like the case is with alcohol why are they more worried about the drug use that would stem from marijuana a less addictive drug than alcohol yet blatantly ignore both the alcoholism and drug use that can come from early drinking maybe its because there isnt as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking wouldnt marijuana go through the same thing alcohol did when it became legal more social acceptance and knowledge of the drug allowing for more conversations between kids and their parents about the right way to do these things without leading to increased hardcore drug use
scalia couldnt be effective without help from the other 4 corporate justices
gtas the only socially transformational legislation in modern american history to be enacted on a straight partyline vote obamacare is wholly owned by the democrats its unraveling would catastrophically undermine their underlying ideology of everexpansive central government providing cradletograve care for an evergrateful citizenry gtfor four years this debate has been theoretical now its real and for democrats its a disaster gtthis is the signature legislative achievement of the obama presidency the embodiment of his new entitlementstate liberalism if obamacare goes down there will be little left of its underlying ideology gtperhaps it wont go down perhaps the web portal hums beautifully on nov 30 perhaps theyll find a way to restore the canceled policies without wrecking the financial underpinning of the exchanges gtperhaps the more likely scenario however is that obamacare does fail it either fails politically renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of democrats or it succumbs to the financial complications the insurance death spiral of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it gtif it does fail the effect will be historic obamacare will take down with it more than mary landrieu and co it will discredit obamas new liberalism for years to come
everyone that answers this question responds with what they are doing and it is more confusing than the thing itself what the fuck is the thing what does it do how do i use it
gthow do we ensure art is made and available by making sure artists are paid
its not surprising that this article takes an antiinvestor stance and is chock full of misleading information its a slow day at work today so i thought id write a few bullet points as i was reading through it 1 blackstone isnt owned by any of those banks listed the fancy sounding sec filing is just a list of who owns blackstones common stock ticker bx the list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage which means if you as a normal person buy for example the jpmorgan large cap value mutual fund you own a portion of those bx shares which gets aggregated in that list not so evil 2 the reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter and safer there are no more zero money down purchases if you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans then you cant also blame them for now not giving these loans 3 the besuited businessmen paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close these companies like blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks or at large auctions not so evil 4 after buying the houses they are hiring property management companies contractors and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible within 90 days thats literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most 5 blackstone isnt speculating on housing prices looking to quickly flip them or creating another housing bubble the key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties these are all houses that already exist and they are simply fixing them back up and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way 6 most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now they dont have 20 savings to put down they are probably living check to check but their family and kids are used to living in a house in a neighborhood they dont want to move into a 1 bedroom apartment building now blackstone comes in and offers the opportunity to stay in a house with the same schools etc this isnt predatory people are paying rent but now they have the option to do so while living in a house 7 now that all these houses are owned by blackstone they are in no hurry to flip them for profit because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them the new boilers new roof and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability most leases are 2 years so there isnt constant turnover and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect 8 eventually the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work see the recent ipo of silverbaysby the company will continue to own and operate the homes pay income to shareholders and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do the exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multifamily apartment real estate investing not so evil ultimately this is actually making it easier for lower income people to live in homes while renting they can continue to save and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budget hopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what blackstone and other institutional investors are doing rather than just shake their fists and yell damn wall street republicans and obama there was a lot of anecdotal malarkey at the end of the article which is where i stopped reading
thank you for this good sir
bs conservative media will continue to lay all blame on the victims and continue repeating the lie that banks were forced into giving mortgages to people that couldnt afford them
except both sides are bad we are in this position because it became the norm after congress didnt pass a budget for 3 years
while i loath apple most of the time in this case i can say that i stand behind them these trolls have to stop i am glad apple is standing up to them i think the entire tech world can agree to that

reddit cherrypicks the popes messages
well we could have electronic voting machines that have fully open source code and use cryptography to verify results but of course theres no money in that
surely though the point could be not lets not have any love and grace to this pastor but you need to have love and grace because if you dont have love and grace youll wind up doing something loveless and graceless for example what this pastor said if you think thats bad then be more loving and gracious
honestly having people like warren and sanders in the us senate makes me wonder what the hell we fought the cold war for what was the point of spending 50 years untold lives and trillions of dollars to defeat communism abroad if we were going to end up electing it at home afterwards

conservatives dont think of their leaders as messiahs or mythical knights in the fictional kingdom of camelot and thus poking fun at them is not sacrilegious he said to the modern liberal who looks to their leaders the way small children look to their parents making fun of obama is simply beyond them evan sayet
this is not exactly a legal grey area u s constitution article vi paragraph 3 is pretty clear gt no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
the gop is a steadily shrinking party so they are desperately putting up walls to cling to power as long as possible
i dont really mind i mean one one hand there are people like chan who downsize and on the other there are people like furtick who go big to each their own and each shall account to the lord for their administration of the wealth given to them
honestly all the profamily movements in american church culture today make me even more resolute to be single two couples from my church got married this summer and as happy as i am for them i shouldnt even have to state that caveat it makes me want to march to the beat of my own drum even more
the perimeters around this relaunching were kept incredibly vague so the administration would be able to call any outcome a success

because they no longer teach civics in schools people forget that the dissension in the us government exists as a selfhealing balance so that no one entity person or party becomes too powerful if too many disagree it cant be good for the majority if enough agree it is likely good for the majority it is only when enough people agree that anything happens the us government structure has these failsafes built in and dissension until compromises are reached is what makes final agreements work

no it was a bad joke when they did it in 2000 and were ordered to stop by the courts it was a repost when they did it again in 2004 and again were ordered to stop it was beating a dead horse when they did it again in 2008 and yes again were ordered to stop its a fucking blatant violation of our constitutional right to vote that they did it again in 2012 and someone should be going to jail at this point
alright as a teen im going to share my experience with youth ministry i go to the life teen program at my church almost every sunday and were a really tight knit group there we actually have deep discussions instead of just fun and games and we have an annual summer retreat which is what i always look forward to in the summer a lot of the people in the head youth ministry office in the archdiocese went to and were leaders of this specific life teen we frequently do things to help out our church community from service projects to raising money teens who go to this llife teen seem more mature and very involved in the church i wouldnt be who i am today without this program

i want to solely blame fox news for the reason our current political climate sucks so much but then i remember that the reaganclinton shift right happened well before fox news ever existed fox news may have extenuated it to unimaginable levels but the core of this whole problem seems deeper than fox news
dude can you imagine if all the media outlets followed suite i would be so happy
saw the same type of thing last year guess what walmart is a greedy corporation just like any other and will never change they dont care about the workers staff are replaceable because there is always someone else willing to do the job for the same or less money you start working there and at some point you are told this in either direct or indirect words and theyre right people are desperate and will do anything to keep a job in todays economy
i believe it would be right cool if the democrats just took over the position of conservative party they do all the consertive stuff quite wellpandering to big money spying on citizens grossly mismanaging public resources the u s hasnt had a progressive party for many years
this massachusetts liberal did so much harm to the conservative cause it isnt even funny he singlehandedly allowed obama and the socialist party to move the overton window so far left that real conservatism isnt even recognizable in the public discourse our only hope is the grassroots support of real conservative american patriots like ted cruz to pull our country back to sanity

what if you believe that the fundamentalists are doing damage the word of christ by driving more and more people away from the message it may not be my job to judge others as that is for god alone but i really really struggle with loving those that hate in a way that says this is not right and others should not follow

i dont think so firstly paxman lingered way too long on russells not voting position for that to have been the case and secondly at one point he even called russell a trivial person

schooling needs to give kids a taste of things and find out what they like are good at and enjoy everything in your post could be applied to any subject in school be it maths sciences history social studies etc i think its pretty flabby that we have art and phys ed but not something like basic programming programming is one of the backbones in modern society and becoming more so every year we really shouldnt continue on this path of producing children who know little about computers besides operating their idevices browsing the web and some gaming ive read a lot of assessments suggesting that kids today are less literate than kids who were born in the 80s its all well and good that weve turned computing into a basic commodity like we did with cars unlike cars though there are dozens of millions of jobs that require high level computing knowledge programming skills problem solving etc not knowing how your car works or how to fix it isnt closing huge amounts of doors to you or possibly limiting your career potential in many industries

ive recently run into these problems with my current pastor i was talking to him about metaphorical interpretations of certain passages in the bible that have been traditionally read literally when i questioned him about why he believes these passages to be literal when all history and evidence points to it being metaphorical he basically told me thats just how it is and that i dont have to analyze it too much he told me hes studied this before he has references to prove it and because thats what he believes in other words he told me to shut up and stop asking questions to me its an insult to intelligence when someone tells me to stop thinking and just believe whats in front of me
the war on who can vote will only work for so long this is the last gasp of a dying political party

yes the minority can force a vote to be called by getting 215 reps to sign a discharge petition the only problem is that it takes something like a month before the discharge petition comes into effect meaning a vote wouldnt be held until november i think we can be sure that boehner will cave before then at least i hope so
because obama is thin skinned
people believe in god because theyve been trained to being scared of death plays some role in it needing to believe that ones own personal successes and failures wont completely dictate their future plays some part in it but mostly its because theyve been trained to based on generations of religion seeping into politics and society

its not just that these people tend to also follow some of the stupidest political corners of facebook that make politics about personal insults and identification rather than issues and facts ive got a few of these people on my facebook flist and some of them even go to my church and pretty much every time they post news i facepalm its gotten to the point where i dont even bother citing primary sources to correct them anymore because i dont have the time and they wont believe em anyway we wont talk about the one guy who sees nothing wrong with posting both socialist and tea party rhetoric hes probably the biggest pariah on my flist though and for a number of reasons that range from petty to oh hey thats one hell of a criminal record you racked up between 18 and 22 to be fair to him though hes past the situations that led him to participate in the activities in question sadly while he is reformed those bad calls from his youth will haunt him for the rest of his life i mean i have some tea party folks on my flist that do respond to facts but the jesus conservatives just dont

well is that really the case because i was under the impression they have to vote in the best interests of their voters not vote for what their voters claim to want right if the reality is the voters are so misinformed that what they want and what is in their best interests arent the same should a representative vote in their best interest or for what their ignorant voters are screaming for honest question
which means a lot of superior officers are complicit

back in grade school when i was still a believer this would bother me so much christian schools youth groups family gettogethers where ever i was it was always uncomfortable watching people jump at the chance to lead prayer or throwing out prayer requests just to be part of something listening to someone use lord as a filler in prayer just as youd use um or like or god forbid when i was volunteered for it what was i supposed to do i know they were just trying to include me and i dont want to start a debate on the ethics of public prayer right before we eat its not even an obscure verse either its in the first gospel you cant even say that it was only applicable for its time and place like half of jesuss mission was preaching against the pretentious self righteousness of the religious leaders trying to cut through the bullshit and make religion more personal to this day it bothers me its like if youre going to be all religiousy then at least follow your own damn religion

this is even worse than the texas roadside ass to vagina episode a while back clearly these cops were on a power trip as no rational person would go to such lengths to confiscate the amount of drugs mr eckert could have possibly been hiding in his rectum the fact that a cop can say you were clenching your buttcheeks and then have such an extensive search done on your person is frightening

from wall street to k street to pennsylvania avenue we find special interests increasingly exempted and insulated by law from the rigors of competition and the consequences of their own mistakes lee said all of this points to what really is an inequality crisis in america today a crisis not of unequal wealth or income but unequal opportunity progressives from the president on down say that inequality in america today is a failure of the free market resulting from insufficient government intervention but if you look closely you start to notice the opposite is true good stuff there

im not a fan of abstinence education anyway but assuming you want it to work you know how long telling people youll definitely get an std the first time you sleep with someone will keep people abstinent right up until they work out that you wont definitely get an std the first time they sleep with someone you know how long telling people you have a four times better chance of a happy marriage if youre a virgin when you get married will last my guess is until theyve asked a couple of searching questions and saying that condoms are only 95 effective and pretending thats nothing and the 95 rate seems to come from a study where a bunch of participants hadnt been taught how to use them is dangerous when kids figure out youre lying to them theyre gonna stop trusting you
its always struck me as odd how the libertarians and teabaggers have almost no respect for intellectual property rights i think its the aversion to intellect
i dont think many people would argue that we shouldnt read the quran at most these articles say if you want to understand islam dont only read the quran there are a lot of hadiths and scholarly rulers history and tradition in islam as well
i am so sick and tired of the whole media cabal bullshit excuse the notion that the solution to the supposed problem is to fire 90 of editors and hire ones you cant control is just plainly stupid there are surely sources of news that are better than others if you rely on 24hour cable news channels like cnn msnbc and fox news as your sole sources of news then yes you deserve constant ridicule if you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you you deserve being ignored if you get all your political news from one political perspective you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a factoriented discussion those people are the problem theyre the ones that resort to making claims of mainstream media bias which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion but what about us readers who rely on several sources to make our conclusion on syria for example i read the washington post guardian reuters ap al jazeera cnn com and several other sources i heard about the administrations claims of intelligence implicating the syrian regime of putins claims that it was the rebels i followed the u n s report findings through the washington post i followed the story as obama brought it to congress the proscons the opinion polls arguments for and against a strike the videos of children dying from the sarin i am more informed these days than ever before so this disgruntled guys claims ring hollow he just comes across as some pissed off guy a cynic without a compelling argument the point is i am grateful for all these news sources and am not convinced by indignant people like hersh that theyre all in the pockets of obama let me ask you this mr hersh what publication is your shining example of journalism you sure as hell didnt say who sets the standard on reporting excellence well the guardian lends you credibility by noting your pulitzer prize youre one of the good guys so who else is winning this prestigious prize in the area of international reporting that he later derides in the article from the past decade 2013 ny times 2012 ny times 2011 ny times 2010 washington post 2009 ny times 2008 washington post 2007 wall street journal 2006 new york times 2005 la times and newsday 2004 washington post 2003 washington post 1970 dispatch news service seymour m hersh so my two most preferred publications nyt amp wp dominate the pulitzer prize for international reporting fire 90 of these editors its trite nothingness any fool can cast stones at an entire profession but how about he put his money where his mouth is and call out some articles some editors some authors he indicates a systemic problem but cant even get close to substantiating it seriously those who agree with mr hersh what news source is your beacon of truth what organizations and people are the standard bearers that the rest of the pathetic media should aspire to be i really want to know because this type of bullshit generalization is a cheap and empty tactic

gthe even says we could eliminate currency and just barter for things id like to see the comment youre talking about because i doubt he would say that what he probably said is that we could eliminate the coercive monopoly on currency e g legal tender laws and still be able to trade with each other just fine hes a voluntaryist so hes obviously fine with currencies that people use voluntarily e g bitcoin private currency silver not ones that the government forces you to use government forces you to claim your income in dollars and they force you to accept them as payment thats a lot different that wanting to do away with currency an ancap would never say that
i think theres some truth to this you really have to be divorced from the reality of how religious thought works not to realize that religious conservatism is an incubator for irrationalism and therefore for all sorts of stupidity and ignorance it is not a coincidence that people who come from a place of heavyhanded orthodoxy superstition and tribalism in religion tend to espouse a particularly irrational brutal politics
i remember that s korea right i was in the navy at the time and a few shipmates and i went out drinking after pulling into port there dont remember what city though anyhow during our bar hopping some guy hands us a flier like that talking about endofworld crap and all threw it away sometime later read about it in starsnstripes that the leader was a harold camping type and people s koreans were all selling their stuff awaiting the second coming

is it just me or is the idea of any judge at any level deciding any case before them based on there own personal viewpoints utterly ridiculous a judges decisions should be made entirely on the facts and arguments presented to them on a case by case basis the bench is not a place for judges to inject there own views political or social or religious or anything judges bought and paid for by either political party or big business is what is undermining the very principals this country was founded on and looks to be destroying any future this country has

i dont wish it on america but i honestly think that until generations suffer from a kind of oppression they will do nothing to prevent it we had a generation oppressed in this way they got tired of it they changed things they taught their children to understand the importance of that change those children taught their children about it but it was a generation removed then those children sort of forgot about it feeling that progress was made and now those things neednt be worried about so those children didnt really teach their children about it at all and now we have a generation that has forgotten entirely history may be cyclical for that reason sadly change takes more generations and if the union system vanishes now it will be quite some time before workers can be free and safe again so no i dont wish it on us but it may also be inevitable

my job offered this but not enough people signed on so they never implemented it you got to pick a day and work 4 10s the rest of the week if too many people signed up for one day some would have to pick another day i couldnt do it because i had to pick up my daughter at certain times now we have flex time and i try to get in at 700 so i can leave at 3 i wish they would make it total flex time allowing us to work extra and it counts towards the same week or leave early and make up for it the next day

i am a young earth creationist but ive never truly looked into it as far as i knowthis is an extremely dumbeddown version scientists look at rocks and their natural processes today and use that to estimate how old the earth is however they assume that the rocks natural processes were always like this and they are not taking in the account of a possible global flood that may have lasted roughly a yearyes i know if you are atheist you more than likely dont believe this story to be true
single payer kills administrative overhead no opt out kills stratification collective pressure to reduce the cost of services benefits the consumer and the taxpayer i think i must be in support of socialized medicine
social conservatives want it both ways they want women to stay home to not use bc to not vote to stfu then they dont want to help those women complain that they have too many kids complain about who is raising their kids want to get rid of the minimum wage and on and on every time one of them tells me about big government my immediate retort is yes big government is a problem they are in my cooch and in my bedroom shuts them up right off
a lot of people dont realize that there are more options than just a single payer system a single payer system would be something like the uk or canada has but other countries provide near universal coverage through other means france and germany still have many private health insurance companies but they provide coverage to all of their citizens the biggest problem with american health care is that the insurance companies are forprofit administrative costs are often over 20 for insurance companies in america while in places like france and germany it is only around 5 or so
my concern is that its not indexed to inflation or the cost of living without that the state legislature will be able to kick the can down the road on minimum wage hikes for as long as they want 10 dollars an hour isnt that much the federal minimum wage in 1968 was 10 68 inflation adjusted and that does not include productivity gains with that included it would be above 20hr while i am not one to support a rise to such a level 20hr may be too extreme i believe a rise to around 1213hr indexed to inflation would be good it would also fit with californias historical image of being a leader among the rest of the states
gt dont post mean comments this fellow is genuinely scared of his government this fellow was caged for a year by the thugs you revere no shit hes scared justifiably so the question is how come you presumably an adult are not scared of people who feel justified in ruining you if you disobey them
also im pretty sure surveys have shown that marijuana is easier for kids to currently obtain than alcohol and even tobacco if anything the argument could be made that legalizing marijuana and regulating it would make it harder for kids to obtain
assuming that the government will automatically balance itself out is terribly dangerous there is little to no indication that the country will ever be able to change anything about the electoral process at this point even though the twoparty system we have has shown to be a staggeringly poor method for representing americans or for preventing corruption

considering president obamas first term began in the throes of the great recession and recovery stimulus was compromised down to be less effective it should have been clear to all from this beginning what the conservative goals were and what they were willing to do to achieve them
i think money in politics is not the whole problem and is probably the minor portion of the problem the problem in my opinion is that politics is a viable career choice in america right now rather than running to do the work of the people politicians run to spend their lives in the senate and enjoy all the power and prestige that comes with belonging to that club then retire with a huge pension and ridiculous benefits governance should be a sacrificial act of public service im not necessarily saying it should be volunteer work but i think congressional salaries should be greatly reduced fringe benefits e g health care retirement pensions etc should be eliminated and term limits should be implemented d c needs to stop being hollywood for ugly people and transform into a meeting place where folks who carry burdens for their communities and this nation come to create or remove laws to improve those communities and our nation as whole and then they should return home to live in the cesspits or havens they created
the result is that god is love and he does everything in love the problems that arise where people get really torn down to their very fiber is the people who are unrepentant evil in a way it is a glimpse at hell where everyone is unrepentant evil and there is no love god has no mercy on evil but his people that do evil he eventually has mercy on jesus comes around in the new testament and forgives us of our sins i do have trouble reading the old testament a bunch like watching a movie where people are doing stupid thingsdo the right thing is what is in your head stop being so stupid and evil you say to yourself then you watch as god really tears people down to their core and awful things occur god wouldnt have brought them to that point if there was any other way for god is a loving god the very cries you have for people in the bible to stop being so very stupid sinful and evil is valid for personal reflection though it is helpful for resisting personal temptation to take a corrupt path

yeah the notion that any party would die is pretty absurd anyway in the end you just have constituencies shuffle around a bit but the republican and democrat parties wont go anywhere anytime soon i do think that the tea party could die as a result of this though or at least be cut off from the mainstream republican party that they have latched onto the problem is that the fringe tea party members in the public seem to think that they really are the majority but since they arent theyre likely to overstep the bounds of public opinion like they are currently doing with the shutdown over obamacare the mainstream republicans are trying to bail them out right now to cover their own ass but i think once the republicans lose the next presidential election due to all the infighting in their party spurred on by the tea part that they will stop placating the tea party and start fighting it for real if theyre smart they could shun the tea party and make them the right wing party to the democrats left wing party while presenting the classic mainstream republican party as the moderate party

heres the definition from the article egonovism is the belief in a god andor a religious structure that is not determined by holy text organized religion or religious leaders it is the egonovists themselves who determine the religious doctrine essentially they make up the rules and they decide how to follow them it is likely that a statistically large number of selfidentified christians fall into the egonovism category they may not even be aware of it but theyve reconstructed christian doctrine in a way that makes sense to them ignoring some parts deemed bad or irrelevant embracing other areas containing relevant wisdom and then filling in the blanks with their own ideas its not just christians who do this people from every major religion living in western society do the same thing

effective camouflage patterns arent bullshit i think ucp the greygreen digital pattern was bullshit and somebody probably lined a pocket or two in the process but a corrupted system should not force soldiers to wear substandard equipment especially equipment that highlights their position to armed opponents second point the camouflage pattern that the army is looking to adopt over ucp is already employed in afghanistan by the army and the air force the money has largely been spent now its just spreading it to the nondeployed army
gtreading the bible should not make anybody an atheist the bible never tries to prove that god exists it takes gods existence as true i dunno i think there are plenty parts of the bible that are construed as arguments hell theres a sense in which any claim thats made about the world is an argument and theres some evidence that ancient texts in the hebrew bible and elsewhere were written to advance a particular theological view or even to argue that insert phenomenon was in fact not a natural event but a divinelysanctioned one i mean nowhere is this sort of argumentation any clearer than in the epistles of paul while in some places he assumes an audience familiar with certain aspects of judaism we know that his churches were significantly gentilic he would have to totally convince them of the reality of a deity that they did not previously embracebelieve in ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature invisible though they are have been understood and seen through the things he has made in acts the author has paul challenging epicurean and stoic philosophers and trying to convince athenians to embrace the gospel further the gospels themselves are structured and have many motifs that were meant to appeal to gentiles to the extent of downplaying jesus judaism

im actually confused by the statement that this article makes saying that the standyourground law had nothing to do with trayvon martins trial although i am aware that the defense did not explicitly claim that zimmermans actions were legal under the stand your ground law i was under the impression that he didnt have to my understanding was that because of the law george zimmermans decision to pursue and confront martin did not disqualify him from claiming selfdefense i had thought that without the law zimmermans decision to pursue and confront martin would have prevented him from using a selfdefense claim because he had decided to put himself into a dangerous situation despite an opportunity to avoid conflict
hmmm 3 hours and no liberal response yet unusual
this is about how i read it the author is saying some argue that if the past is any guide white voters wont vote for a black candidate which was true until obama not that most white voters were necessarily racist they were just more predisposed to identifying with the white candidate

i am surprised i am admitting this when i was 7 i almost commited suicide or at least i mentally tried i was home with my older brother he was playing video games or something i had a large cooking knife think chuky in my hand debating stabbing my stomache my rationale was that because in the mormon religion until you are baptised at 8 all sins are forgiven i kept thinking it was my golden ticket into heaven i knew suicide was wrong but i was too young to be held accountable so yah i dont remember why i didnt do it to be honest i just kept thinking well even though my family will be sad when they get to heaven well be back together and killing myself at 7 just seemed like the quickest and surest way there i guess i chickened out now as a very happy atheist it still sends chills down my spine how close i probably got but who knows i probably would have stopped as soon as the knife scratched me cause scratches hurt ninja edit

speculation before the race was that a lot of people who lean democrat might sit out this election because of a lack of enthusiasm for mcauliffe since turnout is never high for these elections small swings in just how many people care enough to get out to the polls can have a big effect paradoxically when it comes to exit polls people who describe their party affiliation as none or independent arent necessarily the least partisan or most informed voters cuccinellis name dominated the discourse even if most of it was negative this was basically a race between cuccinelli and notcuccinelli
the problem comes when the personality some ascribe to jesus is utterly completely counter to everything he taught us when people who want to worship a schoolyard bully jesus rant about pansies they are not simply behaving counter to jesus teachings themselves they are pretending that jesus was the exact opposite of what he taught ive had people in this subreddit argue that protesting a wedding like a bargain basement fred phelps is acting christlike you cant separate the unloving actions from the hateful personality some want to ascribe to our lord

too much of the purported left seems stuck in a tedious oppositionalist rut rhetorically weaseling for narrow sectarian splinter vanguard hegemony but then the real left does not call for electoral boycott here and now in the us going into the 21st century nobodys perfect in every regard without going into the substance of purported left critique of brand i have my own analysis as to why is he is very substantially incorrect despite being somewhat correct more or less in his critique of capitalism and of its main claim to fame democracy such as we now know it while correct in many regards he is simply politically incorrect to advocate electoral boycott in my analysis those who do so from a purported left position tend to believe its better for the extreme right to prevail electorally based on a theory that the draconian conditions guaranteed to ensue from that will ultimately goad the masses into rising up to overthrow capitalism altogether while voting in bourgeois reformists they say will only serve to lull the masses to sleep thinking its all good now thus preserving capitalism this rationale gave us hitler nixon reagan and bushs and 2010 it has failed to produce revolution anywhere but it has indeed ushered in moar draconian rightwing antidemocratic counterrevolutionary policies ruining the lives of millions of people all over the world and suppressing revolutionary popular democratic struggle for generations i also take issue with the premise that mere bourgeois reforms lull us to sleep or fool us into thinking capitalism is all better now heh reforms only get our nose open for moar give us an inch and well take a mile what better arena to press the contradictions of capitalism and bourgeois democracy a mass electoral uprising to purge and suppress the right from now on would be a good thing seems to me which of course is why the right is freaking out over our first black muslim socialist democrat fascist prez heh who seeks to impose the popular democratic will against the freedom of racist sexist ecoraping rightwing reactionary conservative fundamentalist monopoly corporate fascist murderous ripoff pigs who are now the ones calling for civil war lol the right recognizes that should a more viable democracy emerge it will ultimately mean the death of capitalism as we now know it and of its moribund form fascism i think they see the writing on the wall more clearly than do much of the purported left in this regard but its not over yet the struggle continues
this article gives a glimmer of hope sure but the reality of the situation is grim third party informers the ones mentioned in the article are only active in houston can only do so much my so works for the state health department and not only do they know nothing about how to help people get connected or sign up for the aca a federal training program was scheduled for their department but the governors office called them the day before the training session and told the department that they were not allowed to attend presumably anyone who attended would be fired so the health department doesnt have anyone capable of connecting people with the benefits that the aca offers nor will there ever be anyone in a state gov position that even knows where to start due to forced lack of training make no mistake there will be no progress as the article hopes for as long as the governor uses all the power he has to keep the people in a position to help confused and ignorant

gt charles and david koch are both members of the 00001 thats a group of twenty individuals who have a total net worth of over a halftrillion dollars about 26 billion each i didnt trust a numerical analysis from someone who things that 52 billion over half a trillion dollars so i checked the numbers using the figures from the the excel spreadsheet they link to they gained 12 billion in wealth together 6 billion each thats almost 32 9 million a day 1 37 million an hour 22 8 thousand an hour or 381 a second the article says that the food stamps are for 1 50 a meal so per year thats 1 503365 or 1642 5 therefore it would take them 4 3 seconds to feed her for the year if they were to split her food stamps bill this is absolutely shocking by itself getting the numbers so wrong totally discredits the criticism though and thats a real pity note that im not checking the base figures that the article provides but im not convinced theyre accurate given how careless the author is with the calculations also if ive made a stupid mistake here id love to know if so ill confess idiocy and apologise unreservedly edit i just saw a txt doc that they linked to that says that hes basing it on a 50 week working year and 40 hours a week this doesnt make sense to me given that the money gained was an increase in wealth from investments not salaried income
just when you write a paper in college you have to examine the textual evidence penn jillette had a pretty good review of the evidence and he basically said that the mountain of things that obama has actually said and the fact that he was a member of that chicago church for so long has to be weighed against speculation sure he grew up in a secular home hes exceptionally bright and there is plenty of political motivation and coercion that would lead someone to fake religious belief for gain but unless you are a mind reader you have to base your evaluation on the textual evidence i want to believe that obama is actually an atheist but the evidence says otherwise
if you just look at the whole majority of obamadem voters it is either youth voters with not a care in the world except for getting free shit and partying or adults which tend to have loose morals have done their fair share of drugs and live in san francisco i personally know a person who voted for his bullshit based solely on the premise of him giving away free birth control the new age on the rise in this nation is concerned more about the new iphone and kanye wests baby then their own rights and healthcare the way this nation is heading no wonder nations like china and india are taking our prosperity and economic growth the west has become a place where people would rather fork out money to others to get their problems solved instead of rolling up their sleeves and working or at least trying to give you a story i had a chinese roommate in school who was attending college here in the us now across the hall from us was a room with your normal college students perhaps even smarter now he offered anybody who could do his physics homework 20 to complete it and who took the challenge yes my chinese roommate who finished it in about 10 minutes it just goes to show you the mentality shift in this nation we would rather spend then care whether that goes for health care labor goods etc sorry about the rant but if you think about the big picture it all ties into each other

i thought mitt would have been a good president for this country at this time but those predictions werent all that remarkable they were more likely inevitable outcomes the fact that the media mocked him about it was the absolutely incredulous aspect of this their bias knows no bounds they attacked him on his foreign policy tour even though the vast majority of the things he did and commented on were straight up facts or made sense what we could argue is if romneys solutions would have actually averted these problems at the very least we know he actually had solutions and knew there were problems obama had none

ill speak as the devils advocate here the area where i live is predominantly catholic and predominantly conservative so i will be speaking to catholics here the hate for the aca is palpable here in the affluent philly suburbs yet when i explain to these catholics who are also opposed to abortion and gay marriage because of the churchs teachings that pope francis in accordance with years of catholic social justice teachings stated that healthcare is inalienable right and a moral responsibility of the govt so i pose this question to you how do conservatives go along with the churchs stance assuming youre catholic that healthcare is an inalienable right and the responsibility of the government and yet still oppose the aca and if youre not catholic surely you realize that jesus wouldve helped out the least in our midst i also dont want to imply that religion should be the moral compass for us as americans even if youre an atheist or agnostic protecting and providing for those who are less fortunate than us is something that we should be proud to do and actively encourage to ensure a successful society disclaimer nobody said the aca was perfect president obama has never said that the aca is perfect i support delaying it a year to give the government the chance to work out the kinks in the system
its amusing to me when atheist try to convince me that paying taxes is what god meant by helping the poor if theyre especially ignorant they will say something like remember how jesus said to render unto caesar
this whole thing is embarrassing i honestly believe the republicans thought they had a foolproof gameplan some team of consultants and strategists sat around in a room filled with yesmen and went through all the numbers and tactics that they could think of to use this to make them look like heros eventually they all agreed on this brilliant plan theyd stage some photos spin it around as the dems refusal to work with them then finally get what they want and look like a party that can get things done now its just all falling apart in front of them sure their fox news viewers are on their side but those average american voters are looking at them like they are idiots wow its rare to see such a political melt down i figured the republican divide was going to happen within the next 10 years but maybe well get it sooner
not sure why people are all up in arms about the title religious references almost always over shadow anything else that surround it that and if you actually read the very short article its clear the whole biblical method of rearing the child was the focus i think the homeschooling tid bit is just there to show how controlling these parents were at all times and why the child never had a chance to get help from a typical source like a teacher none of this has a negative stigma to homeschooling in general
feinstein is a complete tool any reforms from her are likely utter rubbish
dont forget the democrats internal memos where they revealed their true justification for blocking estrada his ethnicity as a hispanic conservative he was on the fast track to the supreme court and they couldnt let the republicans be the first to appoint a hispanic judge completely immoral but i guess thats to be expected of the democrats at this point

how is he going to cut off our healthcare he could cut off the exchanges and make it slightly harder for us to find insurance but there is no such thing as federal health insurance the public option does not exist that was the basically onesided compromise that democrats that netted them zero extra support from republicans but if i buy my insurance from a private company through the exchange how exactly is obama going to take that away from me
i assume its because the secret service still uses some of the same tactics for securing a location

aah the othering process in action i think there are quite a few terms in the article that require definition biblebelieving for example the word christian covers a massively diverse array of people across centuries and continents it seems as though what the writer is getting at is the idea of cultural or nominal christianity im not sure why we need a new word for it if anything its unhelpful in terms of dialogue also everyone reinterprets the bible in a way that suits their culture whether theyre aware of it or not there is no such thing as a pure timeless culturally untainted bible believing christian isnt that why we need grace im reliant on god for my salvation not the perfection of my doctrine
the only thing i see wrong is the fact that the kansas city rescue mission pretty much waited until the last minute to tell them they cannot volunteer that is a pretty crappy thing to do if they knew a month ago when they asked then they could have organized something themselves other then that it is perfectly understandable why they do not think that the atheists volunteers would be a good fit as a an atheist i would also have an issue handing out food stuffed with religious pamphlets

im kind of confused by his post and while my healthcare gov application has been stuck for a month now at the view eligibility results stage in other words he has no insurance he says he can pick up the phone etc but he hasnt done so yet hes assuming he can still apply and that there will be no problems there as well perhaps he should finish enrolling first before he says how great it is to be covered
would you be having this problem if it were a conservative pres

hitler was not an atheist stalin and mao ill give you but not hitler hitler was raised christian and retained most of his christian beliefs throughout his life he also happened to be batshit crazy so im not even going to say that his christianity caused or facilitated his atrocities but he was not an atheist i will not budge on that
and also do people forget bush already i know he had some terrible progressive policies in office but before he ran he was definitely viewed as a strong conservative he had that texas mentality southern draw supported low taxes strong on defense etc even with the media constantly attacking him he still won reelection and dont forget reagan go look up his 2nd presidential numbers and see how many electoral votes he got youll think its a typo
so the ends justify the means
there needs to be a baseline for those surveyed im sure the bulk of the 41 are individuals that pay little to no attention to domestic affairs and policies asking if they approve of obamas handling of the health policy is the same as asking them if they like obama

there are already a number of alternatives called altcoins there are usually based off of bitcoin itself with different tweaks if those tweaks make them better then bitcoin they could become worth more however currently bitcoin has a huge lead in terms of the network effect meaning lots of people are involved in mining owning and using bitcoin they already have software and infrastructure in place to work with bitcoins so it would take some effort for them to move to a different crypto currency it could happen but there would need to be a very good reason
i have long been a supporter of voting for moderates because well the democrat option would have been worse ill vote for the lesser of 2 evils and i have been burned every single time too long have i ignored principle in favor of winning elections and the mindset that its all about winning elections is why politicians are such shitty people my vote is no longer given out to people with an r after their name from now on it must be earned if that means losing elections so be it but if you ever want the republican party to get its act together we need to throw out the progressives
they also view it as a one way street and decry the war on christmas so you know its also bullying christians to disagree with them too
crap fica is more than ss payouts so even if fica goes straight into tbills the tbills are then used to finance government operations yes the government is running a deficit but ss is not part of the deficit it is financing the deficit the cure for deficit spending is taxation plain and simple not screwing the people with nothing left to lose
the problem is that republican messaging on health care is easy for americans to digest just dont reform it the ppaca is a major improvement that was sorely needed as a starting point for universal coverage but things like we need to get rid of your garbage sham insurance so you can get better and cheaper options are too complicated to message this countrys voters only want to be told what they want to hear and they want to hear messages that arent longer than a sound bite so long as this is true conservatives running on a platform of keep things the way they are will have an advantage

along the with the trend of universities doing outrageous things i had to take a sexual harassment class for like 20 mins before the year everyone takes them and theyre a complete waste of time everyone purposefully answers them incorrectly just to fuck with them but one question that really was messed up was this if there is an accusation of sexual assault the standard is that the person accused is a more than likely guilty b not likely to be guilty c innocent until proven guilty the correct answer was a are you fucking kidding me in college you are not innocent until proven guilty you are most likely guilty until proven innocent what the hell i wrote to them and ripped them a new one and they had nothing they tried to argue that most likely guilty did not imply guilty until proven innocent umm what if i was in a jury and before hearing anything from a case i said yeah hes probably guilty how in the fuck is that not implying guilt until proven innocent apparently theres a law that the standard for these incidents is such
the holy bible has never condoned homosexual marriage it clearly states it in several scriptures if homosexuality was something that was okay with god wouldnt there have been some essential archetype on which we would be able to base prohomosexuality beliefs god made a man and a woman adam and eve not adam and steve would not god have given us an example where homosexuality was okay the only love between people of the same sex can righteously be seen through philadelphians love brotherlysisterly love between two people of the same sex is okay much like jonathan and king david i hope this has cleared up some things for christians who are unsure of which belief to side with below is scripture from the bible to support my beliefs leviticus 1822 thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind it is abomination leviticus 2013 if a man also lie with mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them romans 12427 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves matthew 1946 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female now of course i believe homosexuality is a sin people struggle with but i am writing this to clarify that yes i love gay people just as much as thieves liars adulterers etc the bible demands that we as christians are still to love them the same and for anyone who believes that we are not you obviously do not read the bible where it says to love everybody that being said god bless you all and have a fantastic day

if marijuana was legalized would it be a safe assumption that most businesses that drug test would stop doing so as far as pot is concerned do they drug test because marijuana is against the law or just because the business owners dont want an employee that gets high what about the governments strict zero tolerance policy

i heard someone let something leak where they found out that all the democratic senators including warren signed a note encouraging hillary to run for president that would be a strange note to sign if you planned on running against her that rumor aside as much as i like warren i still think shes too inexperienced clinton would have arguably more well rounded and applicable experience than any presidential nominee to ever run for president first lady senator and secretary of state her track record at each of those positions is pretty stellar plus looking at the electoral map she has the best chance of any nominee that i can think of democratic or republican due to the fact she could realistically carry arkansas and against governor christie i read somewhere she is polling 4 points ahead in new jersey show me a realistic electoral map where a republican nominee can win without arkansas warren will have her time but i think she should use these 4 years in the senate and whatever other public office she can hold during hopefully clintons 8 years in office before considering a run of her own by that time shell have the experience and political wherewithal to actually be effective and win dont forget that winning is a huge part of the equation

last i checked my bible a jewish mob led by the jewish priests of the time dragged jesus to the roman prefect pontius pilate and basically told him to either execute the man as a traitor or theyd riot and destroy his career pilate tried to reason with the mob and find a way out but ultimately decided a miscarriage of justice was preferable to having the city torn apart with jesus probably just being lynched anyways so it looks like jesus was killed by a mob of 1st century jews how is that controversial
more states should create a state board similar to what california has to draw district lines and create a better functioning democracy we need districts that are able to swing both ways so reps arent beholden to just their party
gthere was a great opportunity for jesus to speak profound wisdom to a man who seemed at times to genuinely want it why didnt jesus tell him because jesus was only as wise as the people writing the story and the answers to philosophical questions arent half as important as the questions themselves
gtvermont also has yet to answer how it will cover everyone vermonter here good luck to us in maintaining the necessary levels of tax revenue to effectively fund a model single payer system when we have the oldest population in the u s and growing in numbers coinciding with watching our 20 and 30 somethings leave vermont to pursue job opportunities and business opportunities out of state its unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong instate business climate to warrant their residence who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most im curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer the governor and the vermont assembly need to take a long hard look at our states constitution before assuming powers not expressed if state lawmakers want the power to provide residents with a state based healthcare solution lawmakers must ask us vermonters for this power by referendum and amend the state constitution upon our consent
this is my fucking senator i hate that man
as a member of the intelligent moderate majority and we are the majority i agree
he can pretty much claim whatever he wants about this blessing since god is on amp not on his side its far too easy for con artists to scam people and live extravagantly using the bible to justify their actions wealth is a sign of righteousness psalm 3725 i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread psalm 1121 praise ye the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments proverbs 1322 a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just proverbs 156 in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble wealth is a sign of wickedness matthew 192324 then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god luke 624 but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation james 51 go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you he sounds like hes running a business more than a ministry via rpolitics he donates the books to the church and allows them to sell them for profit this essentially creates a nice little tax writeoff for him it also blurs the lines between profit from the book and money from the church essentially he is treating your church as a nice little taxhaven his salary is set by 4 other megachurch pastors they also pay an undisclosed amount of money to each other for visiting each others churches its a you scratch my back ill scratch yours situation they also refuse to reveal said salaries essentially this is a very creative and businesslike approach for him and the other megachurch pastors to make millions while denying any responsibility in said salary it is no different than 5 ceos setting pay for each other they bring in over 20 million annually barely over 2 million goes to the community a lot of it goes to production and improvements however unlike nearly every other southern baptist church the pastors pay remains a secret from my understanding these megachurches are an exemption from all other southern baptist bylaws however there is absolutely no reason to keep these salaries a secret unless there is a fear of public ridicule or shame all employees are also required to sign a nondisclosure form and are threatened with a lawsuit if they reveal church financials

said manhattan republican party chairman dan isaacs we were victims of our success its hard to impart to people that the gains weve made could be lost very quickly and this is the fear mongering of the right wing nothing much is going to change maybe the top 10 will pay a tiny bit more in taxes and maybe the bottom 50 will catch a break here or there the real estate interests will still run the place muzzio said the challenge now is maintaining the progress logged under bloomberg while making the city more inclusive

the republicans got what they wanted because the democrats wanted it too the democrats of congress are as a whole not a progressive bunch if we want something better we need a different congress and a different funding model

i wonder what metrics hes using the article doesnt seem to mention them if i had to guess the numbers of strong conservatives probably havent increased but their activity has and is having an effect on the middle 40 of the country
how do we have restore the economy and blow up the finance sector in the same headline
if the republicans would take note that they have chased away the libertarians with candidates like cuccinelli they could easily win the country isnt going more left just look at the statistics the country has a growing classically liberallibertarian wing and we are coming from the right im only in this forum out of curiosity and for the sake of discussion
that is the same 25 of the gop population that votes in republican primaries and continues to move the party farther and farther from reality there are too many angry old out of touch white people that refuse to accept they are a part of the problem and insist everyone else is the problem their logic allows for such gems as cut government spending but increase funding to the local military base because im scared of nearly non existent terrorism on american soil cut the debt but lower taxes keep your government hands off my medicare and dont give it to those people includes anyone that does not look or think exactly as i do
gt i have been reading a lot of articles about blackstone just because they have deep pockets doesnt mean they know what they are doing ltcm anyone gtthe idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous they cant maintain those properties properly each house has its own set of unique issues because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves i wouldnt say it isnt doable because it certainly is but only if they are building out a solid reliable system of property management to take care of all of the issues instead they seem to be focused on repackaging and selling this shit reaping the short term profits and leaving others as the bag holders imo this is potentially even worse than the traditional slumlord model

whats really haunting is the phrase adopted daughter i cant help but think of whatever unfortunate circumstances took place that ended up with hana needing to be adopted and the sort of trust that children inherently have in their guardians in another article they mention that hana was 13 and adopted from ethiopia she crossed oceans and continents expecting a life better than the one she was leaving behind i cant even fathom the confusion and betrayal she felt as the people who saved her from one sort of hell would be the ones she that would need saving from
agreed reading the bible by itself doesnt do anything to make someone an atheist its taken as fact in the bible that god exists one could definitely judge gods character to be less than omnibenevolent or the way he does things to be less than omnipotent in our eyes but those issues dont have any bearing on whether he exists or not

yeah she just confirmed it
obama was supporting known terrorist organizations and spent two weeks lying about the nature of a terrorist attack even after it was known the administration was lying they continued with the lie until they couldnt any more why obama hasnt been impeached over benghazi or a multitude of other equally serious scandals is beyond me
this from the people who scream that obama has taken their freedoms away
mlk would be probably be ashamed of what happened to this country the boondocks did a pretty great satire exploring that point the problem is people who advocate for civil rights are not advocating for all of them just for themselves or whoever they are guilted into advocating for everyone always assumes that the civil rights only worth fighting for include women lgbt illegal immigrants blacks but neglect things like gun ownership right to privacy freedom of religion across the board from catholics to muslims to norse and everything in between as if they forget that those are civil rights as well and are being tarnisheddiminished
this is going to piss off reddit radviceanimals is already drawing up a protest meme as we speak
exactly im a right leaning independent and i really cant stand either party but at this particular time in history one is batshit insane on the wrong side of just about every major issue not to mention some pretty significant social and demographic trends and has lost all interest in governing there is nothing left of the 90s gop type candidates that i used to support
i think the article made it pretty clear that the influence she holds in the senate could have a far greater influence on policy than what she or anyone could do as president the senate as a whole absolutely holds more power than the president and therefore senators who can influence the entire body or at least a majority hold a unique power in the government not to mention that her strengths are specifically as a consumer advocate who is tough on wall street and banks does that translate to being a great president not necessarily does it translate to being a great senator absolutely because you are allowed to focus on a narrower range of interests and lastly while she has great appeal to liberals and progressives she doesnt exactly have that same appeal all over the country middle of the road voters the type you need to win presidential elections still fear the picture that the right is able to pair of people like her to be clear they dont fear her unfiltered policy ideas they fear the politician that the right would portray her as so yes i resoundingly approve of her politics and would rather she stay in the senate and i am very sane
in the words of jason jones this is not a fucking game
1 is meaningless words around a false dichotomy 2 is an attempt to repackage pascals wager im certain pascal came before cs lewis 3 is more meaningless words the kind that can mean anything depending on the reader and therefore really hold no meaning something that can mean anything is ultimately meaningless 4 echoes words that have been said for probably as long as weve had words to say certainly best summed up by shakespeare tis better to have loved and lost there is nothing ahead of its time about that 5 amounts to actions speak louder than words any form of this statement is not new or ahead of its time 6 is wishful thinking also not a new concept which should be patently obvious in this sub given the majority here hold to a belief started some 2000ish years ago that the things in your future will be better than the past behind you i dont think cs lewis predates christianity 7 is a repackaging of the concept of suffering for god once again i dont think cs lewis predates christianity 8 is a statement that would hold true no matter when it was said in that way it was of its time when he first said it not ahead of its time 9 is probably the only example of a thought from cs lewis in this list that is ahead of its time though i genuinely doubt it is a thought that wasnt expressed or taught or followed by some congregations somewhere in the world throughout the history of the church 10 basically says heaven is good thats not a thought ahead of its time once again cs lewis does not predate christianity less of a list of quotes that show he was ahead of his time more of a lot of repetition of previous philosopherstheologians a collection of meaningless phrases and a single progressive thought

the policy on cuba is probably the most antiquated we have the cold war is over yet we continue those policies on that country and that country only how many americans have they kidnapped or killed in the last 30 years yet we continue to do business with saudi arabia a country which produced most of the hijackers for 911 what if those 19 saudi hijackers were cuban extremists sanctions would be tightened regardless and maybe even another invasion would have been considered its so ridiculously antiquated it would be hard to take seriously if it werent for the real human cost our embargo causes
honest question yahoo news why is the fact this lady is a member of the tea party important i feel like local school district politics is a completely different ballgame where people of wide varying ideologies can come together to push forward a common agenda im sure theres plenty of democrats republicans libertarians independents etc who are also planning to vote against this bond for their own reason also
ive had my own issues with youth group but i think this article is overreaching gtthe inherent result of youth groups is that teenagers in the church are focused on their peers not their parents or their pastors its a foreign sociology that leads to immaturity a greater likelihood of sexual activity drug experimentation and a rejection of the authority of the word of god seriously what kind of youth groups is he talking about and in those youth groups are the adults actually any different and i thought this juxtaposition was interesting gtour fervent prayer is that god will raise up spiritfilled biblepreaching christcentered familyintegrated assemblies from the ashes of our mancentered familyfragmenting churches with gtits time for the christian father to take the central role which god has ordained mcmanus concludes gathered around the dining room table the father needs to lead family worship once again which had been standard behavior for a vibrant american christian family for hundreds of years dating back to the plymouth mass colony of 1620 dad needs to read from and discuss the bible sing christian songs and pray with his family his little flock over which god has appointed him shepherd i mean i get what its saying but the last paragraph sounds pretty mancentered to me

my motherinlaw watches way to much cable tv and loves msnbc and any documentary that talks about how we are raping the plant bombing brown people etc i have been telling her for years that this whole thing was going to fall apart and it is a big fat lie she must have zero memory because she told me on sunday i called and the plan is no help at all i will have to pay a lot of money and have a 6k deductible i have been lied to the thing is it is hard to enjoy the disappointment of the died in the wool liberals as it is damaging our country
the koch brothers are driving society into a 21st century feudalism

she seems to make a point of knowing nothing about anything for example the assault weapons ban is one of her big things and yet she seems to lack even a cursory knowledge about guns i just dont get how someone whose job affects the entire country cant talk to an expert or read a fucking wikipedia article every once in a while
scumbags like that wannabe pastor is why people dont wanna trust god and his promises to take care of us i am constantly making mistakes so im not at all saying im better than him however i hope god either changes that louse or takes away his leadership position before he hurts anyone else
gt minimum wage isnt supposed to be livable you know id be fine arguing this one if we werent in the current economic situation were in minimum wage jobs were supposed to be for kids working their first jobs part time to get some entrylevel work experience under their belt everyones got to start someplace right or theyre for moms of schoolage kids who need extra spending money and a flexible schedule of 9am 3pm or theyre for retirees who have investment income but want to get out of the house and just need something with low responsibility but high social interaction once you got a few years and a few 25 raises under your belt you went on to better pay and better skill jobs either during or after college the problem now is that those better skill jobs havent opened back up since 20082009 so the only jobs that are available are the ones that are 9 an hour or less technically above minimum wage but not liveable and certainly not ones that demand the skills college grads and mid20s or older already possess so if the only jobs that companies are willing to hire for are the lowskill minimum wage positions without much hope of raises or even promotions since a lot of companies have severed the wage increase from the title promotion then those jobs damn well better pay enough that a single person can support themselves without having to rely on anyone else if you work a second job in order to save up money to better your situation great if you get a roommate in order to save up money to better your situation great if you do either or both of those things because nobody is willing to pay enough to let you pay the rent and eat no so great
i think healthcare forprofit is a perverse way of doing things socialized medicine might not be superior but forprofit medicine is just ugly why treat the poor when theres no profit in that just like telecoms leave rural areas in poor connectivity no profit in wiring up the countryside
the more important question here is should the government be allowed to issue secret rulings and legal precedents
dont blame religion the kid had issues and probably would have found a reason to do it anyway
where was obama at in 2007
whether or not you agree that what theyre doing is necessary or good youve got to admire their willingness to stick to what they think is important
this makes my brain hurt i have absolutely no problem with going to a bar even having a small group or prayer service there but having a eucharistic service and your main services there no just no its like in christianity today reverence has become something evil and negative to be avoided at all costs and how does anyone think this will work when we show we think so little of the holy things that we do them in bars while getting shitfaced thats supposed to impress the people there and seriously draw them to conversion i think if i was a random guy on a bar id conclude that any belief system whose members regarded it so cavalierly wasnt worth my time
and people are crying in rconservative because a misleading article is being downvoted ok
i just want to thank you for taking a stand on christian principles its disgusting that even on a supposedly christian forum youre getting flack from other christians for taking a stand on clear scriptural truths
i will always maintain that giving these people so much money is insane make them send their kids to public school and see how fast our education system would improve make them take the same public transportation as the rest of us and see how quickly things improve you cant serve a public you are so detached from on a basic day to day level

42 with the tea party i did not think it was that high
so obamas failure is that he didnt get the right progressive in congress to pass the right laws thats a pretty poor argument for the extent of presidential power
now i really want to know why no one sent any military support to not send additional security when it was asked for prior to the attack could be brushed off as an oversight although i dont think it should be but to not send help while a coordinated attack was undeniably underway makes no sense to me and i cant help but think that decision was politically motivated
in one hand i carry fire in the other water with the water i will quench the fires of hell with the fire i will burn down heaven i do these things so that no man will seek heaven for the glory of god or the fear of hell or something like that
almost all if not all of the states tied to that rule still have the same issues they had 50 years ago which is why all of those states immediately went ahead to vote in more voting restrictions the second it was removed
serious question what does that make us because it kind of feels like being hostages not specifically to extremist political factions but to a broken and corrupt system that allows extremism to dictate the future after all the shouting back and forth between team red and team blue were all going to look up and realize that there are guards at the door bars on the window and cameras on the walls
i think its a bit presumptuous to assume that getting rid of one of our two parties will lead to anything good please recall that a new party or parties is no more likely an option than just having one party

i sometimes listen to beck i subscribe to the blaze for the most part i like him but this statement or lack of action is just stupid if its christie vs clinton 2016 i am voting for christie primaries may be a different story it is up to conservatives to put someone we like in the race not christie or anyone else
this favors aetheists so its religious discrimination either way
did he ever threaten it though iirc he basically never seriously indicated that he would do it so this gives me hope

if warren runs i will caucus and volunteer for her if its hillary i will vote for her but only because she wont be as bad as whoever the republicans run but thats about it im so fucking sick of the establishment democratic candidate i thought i was campaigning against it with obama turns out he was just another one
considering homophobia in general is on its way out i imagine a trend will come from this not to suggest that popularity makes truth but when society accepts our lgbt brothers and sisters as equal its going to be as hard to get members for a church that preaches otherwise as it is to get members for a segregationist church is today

i live in a small town which thrives on its tourism industry all the business owners around here learned from the recession is how few employees their businesses can function on now that the economy is bouncing back they arent hiring employees to make up for the difference instead they just drive their skeleton crews into the ground and burn people out when someone quits they know there are hundreds of other people who are desperate for a job through the winter its really really fucked up
the poll is not as indicative of the publics view on his policies as much as wed like to think when viewed in the context of congress low approval ratings 10 percent this poll is more indicative of people disliking their dysfunctional government the reason that the number is that high is due to his base supporting his policy positions regardless of his ability to implement them he can simply blame republicans and as long as republicans continue a political strategy that makes them appear that theyre not willing to compromise he can call them a bully and continue to have high polling numbers
why would they champion it anyways there is a key difference you and your wife losing a child do to miscarriage and aborting is not the same for the parents

back in 2000 during the napster days few people seemed to realized this i think of it as a game changing revelation there used to be a general assumption if you offer the media on the web it was guaranteed to be stolen which inevitably would destroy your business model i dont know why so few people realized convenience is far more powerful motivator than price or lack of price it just didnt seem to dawn on many of us in the industry at the time

not to be a buzzkill but you can bet the vast majority of those veterans voted republican and will continue to do so you cant make the weather then complain when it rains the gop agenda parted ways with their socalled ideology a long time ago anyone and i mean anyone making less than 750000 a year that votes republican today is a bona fide idiot they need to stop voting a party line and start voting for the party that really represents their interests

money shot from the end gt the virgin birth mary probably made up the story of god impregnating her so that she would not be an outcast or stoned to death for being a teenage unwed mother she could have been raped by a roman soldier or some other pervert as were thousands of young women back then the women were penalized more than the rapists she could have just told a big lie and started christianity she would have had to tell jesus that he was the son of god to keep the lie going so he grew up really believing god was his father jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of god because he just believed what his mother told him this inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious what he called the holy spirit this gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did he looked for the truth in the present because he believed god his father would try to communicate with him just thinking this opened up the door to the universal mind and the truth and the life jesus was very openminded and brave tldr believes the jesus story is a myth but that the bible still holds truth im going to pass
hes still on the air
if you actually bothered listening to him you would know that he doesnt criticize the rich for making money but for attempting to set up the system to ensure that they stay as wealthy as possible while those that are not rich cannot move up there is nothing wrong with being a warren buffett and making billions if you dont spend a chunk of that making sure that you dont have to pay taxes and destroying the system that allows for social mobility

gtof course the obama administration is to blame for the botched rollout but there are other culprits getting less attention namely global tech conglomerate cgi which was responsible for the bulk of the execution and in general the ability of big corporations to get massive taxpayerfunded contracts without enough accountability gtgovernment outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies pockets about 80bn of which goes to tech companies weve reached a stage of kneejerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias and its damaging in multiple levels gtfor one thing farming work out often rips off taxpayers while the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent timewasters drooling over their texas instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions studies show that keeping government services in house saves money in fact contractor billing rates average an astonishing 83 more than what it would cost to do the work inhouse hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the us while contractors especially in the it space can ship taxpayerfunded work overseas gtfortunately then there are alternatives to outsourcing public functions to big corporations padding their profits at taxpayers collective expense and it is time we used them click thru for more

the reason they wasnt encrypted was because this was on an online service that allowed people access to their bitcoins whenever they wanted so the private keys had to always be accessible serverside from a tech point what they stole is control of the coins registed in the bitcoin protocols distributed ledger they managed to get the site owners private ecdsa cryptographic keys and used them to sign a bitcoin transaction to the thiefs own bitcoin address

i agree with the premise of this article but i would reply with why cant we have both why cant we have scripture knowledge and purity along with love and humility i think its dangerous to take an its all good approach to religion because scripture is very clear to avoid false prophets and teachers as they can lead us astray i actually would venture to say that scriptural knowledge leads us to love and humility

remember all those angry lectures that obamacare was settled law the democrats said its the law of the land you cant change it well so much for that so much for the rule of law so much for constitutional republicanism now we have the president playing dictator the other way to save his partys bacon and to save his dream of governmentrun socialized medicine rush

its ok shit isnt a word you should be concerned about heres a story someone somewhere sometime decided to create a new word that means the same as poop but isnt poop they started using it and then more people started using it and then someone decided they were going to be offended by it this person then created a rule somewhere that this word is bad and then more people began following the rule and eventually it became a societal norm to believe that shit was a bad word even though it literally means poop and saying it was a sin if its not in the bible friend i wouldnt consider it a sin or even something bad its just a word that someone else decided you couldnt say

pretty much the same here i remember when bitcoins went above 10 i think they even peaked at around 30 and stayed there for a while but then dropped to around 45 back then there was a lot of discussion on bitcoin forums whether it would be a good investment to just buy a bunch of bitcoins and sit on them hoping that their price would increase the general consensus was pretty much nah you might double your money in a few years if youre lucky but thats about it who would have thought that you could profit 1000 in just a couple of years iirc i have about 0 16btc in my wallet acquired by mining havent used bitcoin in ages and back when i earned that it wasnt really worth anything but apparently now even that would be worth around 80 crazy

fucking a guys the only reason we have been winning elections is because we appear normal compared to the tea party i dont necessarily like clinton but she would win 2016 ensuring that the supreme court would be dominated by liberals for the foreseeable future it would be easier for a liberal supreme court to overrule previous rulings like citizen united than it would for congress which will remain divided due to the republican gerrymandering of crucial swing states that allow them to hold the house despite losing the popular vote the greatest strength republicans had until 2010 was that they fell in line this is what democrats have done since then and it has allowed us to hold the presidency along with the senate elizabeth warren is to the democrats as ted cruz is to the republicans they represent the the beliefs of the base but do not reflect the attitudes of the general electorate which despite obamas election and reelection remains centreright all she would do is hurt hillary in the primary by forcing hillary to move further to the left just as santorum and gingrich forced romney to move further and further to the right winning the 2016 election is all that matters fall in line the day will come when we can elect a candidate like senator warren but it is not this day dont confuse me for a moderate as i fall into the british school of economics and would like nothing more than to see a reimplementation of new deal fiscal policy but our current political climate will not allow that and losing the presidency would allow republicans to cut more programs than we are seeing now with obama we have to hold the line look at the big picture

im an ardent leftist but i agree with him the moral relativism amongst my friends often descends into abstract lunacy with few people willing to definitively condemn or support anything for fear of offending someone else or being excoriated themselves the left eats its own in my experience just as well as the right does with many desiring to make their reputations on the bloody husks of colleagues who were not left enough in a culture of shaming and ridicule that can be painful to watch

edit ill preface with thisthe title and article linked above is a misconception of most progressives because most republicans are believers in the free market i may get nuked for this but the tea partiersconservativesrepublicans dont have a plan because no plan is necessary because if you remove the laws holding back entrepreneurs from starting a business they will fill the hole with a serviceproduct at competitive prices because others will be offering samesimilar productservices this competition is what drive prices down customers voting with their money its a perfect example of the argument of centralized planningampcontrol vs free market one of the arguments for years is that if insurance companies could in the past have offered plans nationwide rather then limited by state borders the dollar cost averaging of health care would have been more effective anyway my 2 cents
this is an interesting point there are no shortcuts in materials engineering cheap 3d printers may be great for prototyping and for soft materials e g in the range of plastic up to lighter structural metals but some kind of tools requires specific materials that requires very specific processing that may be hazardous high temperatures fumes toxic byproducts and costly energy short lifespan of machinery when working hard parts long post production testing if 3d printing is the silver bullet for an industrial process i expect the first ones to embrace it being professional operators where any edge over competitors means millions and i expect some delay if ever for the process being accessible for general purpose low cost equipment and last but not least i dont expect a single process even if flexible and advanced as 3d printing to be ever able to replace any other kind of specialized processing molding laser cutting welding machining each single process is more effective in its context
maybe you mean how we are to respond to the gospel or how the gospel affects us and gives us salvation i mean the basic gospel is the life death resurrection and ascension of jesus christ and r catholics definitely see that the same as any other christian
