i have written before about president obamas apparent failure to read his daily security briefings i think this comment from him sums up exactly what i mean throwing clapper under the bus along the way our head of the intelligence community jim clapper obama said has acknowledged that i think they underestimated what had been taking place in syria but in reality the administration was warned all along about the rise of isisisil defense intelligence director lt gen michael flynn had warned president obama and repeated that info to congress from the attached article by february 2014 we had generals basically reading out their memos to congress he added referring to testimony from lieutenant general michael flynn the director of the defense intelligence agency flynn predicted isis probably will attempt to take territory in iraq and syria to exhibit its strength in 2014 the islamist terror group had already seized fallujah and ramadi he said had the ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in syria by the time flynn spoke on capitol hill congress had already heard the story at least once before assistant secretary of state brett mcgurk told a house foreign affairs subcommittee in november 2013 that isis had been militarily active all year because of a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of iraqi security forces poor operational tactics and popular grievances which remain unaddressed it has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in syria control of lucrative facilities there such as oil wells and regular movement of weapons and fighters between syria and iraq mcgurk said

unacceptable and america can do better and we must the recession has wiped out 8 million jobs and it is imperative that we get them back that is why i introduced the invest in us act this legislation

in my latest installment of ask peter i respond to an email from karen werle in algonquin who asked about #obamacare architect jonathan grubers comments that passing obamacare relied on the stupidity of the american voter and a lack of transparency the american people are not fooled this law was crafted behind closed doors and rammed through congress on a partisan voteand the results have been disastrous as a result millions have been kicked off their healthcare plans or have seen their premiums skyrocket while businesses have been forced to cutback their workforces thats why i introduced legislation to create an independent watchdog to monitor obamacare which would help bring muchneeded transparency and accountability to the presidents healthcare law #grubergate

more debt w zero spending reforms unacceptable i strongly believe we must act to avoid defaulting on our debt payments and reopen the government but i cannot support a plan that increases our nations debt by half a trillion dollars while offering no spending reforms washingtons addiction to spending is what led to this mess and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach a better way forward would be honest simple legislation that 1 takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms 2 provides temporary government funding and 3 allows us time to work toward a real budget i know a majority of republicans and democrats would ultimately support such a plan the problem is the shutdown strategy damaged the houses bargaining power in these negotiations i hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular americans striving to protect americans from obamacares harmful mandates and taxes setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit and pushing a progrowth agenda that will help create jobs for people in alabama and throughout the country robytovotenoon
