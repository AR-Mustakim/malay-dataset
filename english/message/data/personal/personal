on monday a jury found trinity highway products to have committed fraud in failing to adequately notify federal officials of changes to their guardrails the heads installed at the end of these rails are intended to slide along the rail and absorb the impact in the case of an accident trinitys new railswhich they saved about 2 per head onoften jammed causing the rail to pierce vehicles putting lives in danger this is unacceptable and it took far too long for the us federal highway administration to start asking the right questions the more i learn about the supposed watchdog function of these federal agencies the more concerned i am about how cozy they are with the industry today i called on the federal highway administration to expedite their investigation into trinity and to provide a full report on their findings and how they have responded to safety concerns thus far

what did you think of barack obamas speech on #immigration
#scotus got it wrong with #hobbylobby thats why im supporting the protect womens health from corporate interference act the legislation would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the #acat and protect coverage of other health services from employers who want to impose their beliefs on their employees by denying benefits allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable the supreme court has put the health of american women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer the affordable care act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services including contraception imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent #notmybossbusiness
