from the article apparently the president assumed incorrectly that the janitors on capitol hill would get a pay cut rather than admit an error white house aides doubled down on their talking points about overtime being essential to their livelihood without actually knowing the truth
president obama has previously described his healthcare law as a new set of rules that treats everybody honestly and treats everybody fairly but as of a few weeks ago according to pres obama if youre a big financial institution or government contractor you dont have to comply with obamacares mandate next year but if youre a tennessee family trying to make ends meet you do or you get taxed and to add insult to injury the president now has the gall to say that he will veto the house passed the legislation delaying obamacares employer mandate and individual mandate his veto threat is a pathetic excuse for leadership share like if you want the senate to follow the houses lead and call the presidents bluff by passing these common sense bills to give all americans muchneeded relief from obamacare #trainwreck #fairnessforall #tbt

obamacare is putting us at risk of becoming a nation of parttime employees i am proud to sign on as an original cosponsor of the saw act which puts an end to obamacares arbitrary definition of a fulltime workweek at 30 hours this provision is costing employees their hours at work and the wages they rely on to support their family invest in their community and save for their future we should be focused on doing everything we can to help americans find meaningful employment not limit their opportunities read my full statement here releasebucshoncosponsorssawact

the obamacare train wreck continues
we just got a phone call from a constituent who is losing his health care plan because of the affordable care act its a plan he and his wife have had for years his 5000 deductible is going up to 12700 and his monthly cost is increasing from 397mo to 831mo the affordable care is act is proving to be anything but affordable
we dont have a spending problem this pie chart from investors business daily is a pretty good illustration of how the federal budget and deficit has grown under president obama
heres some highlights of what weve passed this week to #stopgovtabuse the foia oversight and implementation act makes it easier for you to request information and also holds government agencies accountable to your requests the taxpayers righttoknow act provides taxpayers with an annual report disclosing the cost and performance of government programs as well as a list of duplicative programs the taxpayer transparency and efficient audit act requires the irs to respond to taxpayer inquiries within 30 days and the protecting taxpayers from intrusive irs requests act prohibits the irs from your religion politics or social beliefs for a full list click here
this morning i joined democratic whip steny hoyer at a press conference to highlight the house democrats focus on creating jobs through our make it in america agenda meanwhile senate republicans spent the morning blocking my legislationthe #bringjobshome actthat will help bring high paying manufacturing jobs back to our shores this afternoon house republicans will attempt to sue the president though a partisan lawsuit that is simply wasting time and taxpayer money instead of focusing on the real problems facing our country you really couldnt pick a better example of the differences in priorities than by looking at whats going on in congress today
as this chart from the house budget committee demonstrates under the budget agreement just announced spending levels for fy 2014 will actually be lower than the fy 2014 spending levels included in the previous house republican budgets supported by the majority of house republicans and far below the levels included in the senate democrats budget
debate has begun on my bill hr 2009 to prevent the irs from implementing or enforcing obamacare you can watch it on cspan or at

ill be live at 710 pm et on lou dobbs tonight on fox business to discuss the latest on the #insidious lies of #obamacare
today for the 37th time the republicans in the house of representatives will attempt to repeal the affordable care act it is needed by our nation it was approved by the house and senate it was signed by the president and it was upheld by the supreme court it is time to move on and implement this much needed law
i was extremely disappointed that republicans passed an amendment today that targets hundreds of thousands of dreamers who through no fault of their own were brought to this country as young children these children have lived in the united states for years as lawabiding individuals however the amendment adopted by house republicans today draws no distinction between dreamers and criminals posing security risks to our communities we need an enforcement policy that focuses our limited resources on enhancing public safety by targeting serious criminals not dreamers see my full statement below
president obama will negotiate with the russians and the iranians but he will not come to capitol hill and talk with the duly elected representatives of the american people he wants to see the government shut down but that is not what we want or what hardworking americans want obamacare is not ready to be rolled out on october 1st and it is going to drive our economy into the fiscal ditch the house will vote on a delay of the individual mandate for one year we believe that americans should be afforded the same consideration that the president has promised to big business we also want fairness for all and have included a measure that will strip out the federal contribution for members staff the presidents cabinet and political appointees the house has been the only one fighting to avert a government shutdown we have worked through the weekend while the senate stayed in recess the president has refused to speak with the peoples elected representatives it is time for the senate and the president to become engaged and fight for commonsense solutions for the american people a government shutdown will only be temporary but obamacare is going to have long term consequences that will stifle our economy
what we have is a broken budget process lurching from short term funding bill to stop gap measure months into a fiscal year is no way to manage a government ideological issues aside daytoday congressional business is broken and needs serious lawmaking to be repaired the appropriations committees were once in charge of a lot of the congressional calendar now everything seems to be run by leadership and run through the rules committee regular order bypassed the shutdown crisis is a result of that broken process that said why cant house leadership bring up a clean stopgap measure to allow more time to deliberate on bread and butter issues a clean continuing resolution cr would get big bipartisan votes and pass in just a few hours i will vote for a clean cr
by delaying another component of his signature law for a select few president obama has yet again confirmed what weve long said his health care law is unworkable and harming american families
number of the day 1 its been 1 year today since the supreme court ruled that obamacare is the law of the land since then weve seen premiums increasing millions of americans losing the plans they have billions in tax hikes fewer people covered millions more uninsured and job losses no wonder a majority of americans disapprove of this monstrosity
#obamacare passed because a lack of transparency and the stupidity of the american voter sorry what
even members of his own party are frustrated with obama over his lack of concern for our immigration problem
the constitution is clear president obama cant pick and choose which laws to enforce and implement thats why my colleagues and i passed the enforce the law act which permits congress to take judicial action against the executive branch for failure to execute the law from obamacare to amnesty to stricter gun control this imperial presidency and disregard for the constitution must end
