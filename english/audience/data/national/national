i was very proud to lead a group of my colleagues in speaking on the floor of the house last night to promote and support hr 3685 the protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act this legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the affordable care act aca the bill has more than 80 cosponsors including members of both parties an unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances this really took me by surprise the fact that the aca could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine that would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether simply put this is a public safety issue ive been concerned that since the internal revenue service irs currently views volunteer firefighters as employees fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety i sent the irs a letter in november requesting a clarification but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today under the employer mandate provision employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties this could be problematic for fire companies particularly in pennsylvania where 97percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways by themselves based on their size by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think well weve only got 25 volunteers so were safe we dont have fifty that may not necessarily be the case some fire companies are considered part of their local government that could mean that if you take the number of firefighters paid and unpaid now considered employees by the irs and add them to the number of other public employees you can easily reach fifty even in a small town

the government of #azerbaijan has arrested ms #leyla yunus director of the institute for peace and democracy in azerbaijan and her husband #arif yunus and charged them with high treason tax evasion and other economic crimes the charges filed against the #yunuss are outrageous both leyla and arif are longtime supporters of peopletopeople contact with #armenia and the charge of espionage against them is absurd we urge the government of azerbaijan to drop the charges and to stop the coordinated campaign aimed at the opposition civil society and journalists in azerbaijan who are peacefully exercising their right to freedom of speech and freedom of association
#scotus got it wrong with #hobbylobby thats why im supporting the protect womens health from corporate interference act the legislation would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the #acat and protect coverage of other health services from employers who want to impose their beliefs on their employees by denying benefits allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable the supreme court has put the health of american women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer the affordable care act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services including contraception imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent #notmybossbusiness

i spoke on the senator floor this afternoon on how new rules proposed earlier this week by the environmental protection agency will impact hoosiers
this morning i offered an amendment to reform the emergency unemployment compensation euc program as part of legislation currently under consideration by the full senate that would extend unemployment benefits my amendment would strengthen existing requirements to ensure unemployment benefits are going to individuals actively looking for work and individuals who truly want to return to the labor force the amendment would prohibit individuals from receiving euc benefits if they fail to accept any offer of suitable work defined as work within their capabilities or if they refuse to apply for suitable work referred to them by a state employment agency states would have flexibility to enforce this requirement consistent with their state laws we need to ensure that only those who are actively seeking work but cannot find it are receiving these benefits i have heard repeatedly from frustrated employers in indiana who have offered jobs but are told by the applicants that they would rather keep collecting unemployment benefits until they run out this undermines the core idea of a program designed to help those only in emergency situations who are unable to secure employment we are waiting to see if majority leader harry reid will allow votes on republican amendments

for the first time in four years we are in a position to pass a budget agreement with strong bipartisan support in both the house and the senate the bill is not perfect and neither side is happy with everything in the agreement however in a year filled with far too much partisan fighting this compromise is an important step forward programs that help create jobs in pennsylvania such as community development block grants and nih medical research will likely face fewer cuts under this deal in addition overall deficit reduction will be approximately 20 billion higher under this agreement than without it moreover the bill will allow us avoid another damaging government shutdown i am hopeful that the measure will pass the senate and that the spirit of bipartisanship will continue into next year #budget

i have written before about president obamas apparent failure to read his daily security briefings i think this comment from him sums up exactly what i mean throwing clapper under the bus along the way our head of the intelligence community jim clapper obama said has acknowledged that i think they underestimated what had been taking place in syria but in reality the administration was warned all along about the rise of isisisil defense intelligence director lt gen michael flynn had warned president obama and repeated that info to congress from the attached article by february 2014 we had generals basically reading out their memos to congress he added referring to testimony from lieutenant general michael flynn the director of the defense intelligence agency flynn predicted isis probably will attempt to take territory in iraq and syria to exhibit its strength in 2014 the islamist terror group had already seized fallujah and ramadi he said had the ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in syria by the time flynn spoke on capitol hill congress had already heard the story at least once before assistant secretary of state brett mcgurk told a house foreign affairs subcommittee in november 2013 that isis had been militarily active all year because of a permissive operating environment due to inherent weaknesses of iraqi security forces poor operational tactics and popular grievances which remain unaddressed it has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in syria control of lucrative facilities there such as oil wells and regular movement of weapons and fighters between syria and iraq mcgurk said
i have said for years now that we could bring energy costs down if we pursued more domestic production and american energy independence it is a matter of supply demand with oil and gas development happening in n dakota and texas state and private lands btw is where it is happening and it could boom in pennsylvania new york with marcellus shale as well as california with monterey shale and alaska with anwr npr supplies are way up from increased production coupled with a sluggish global economy which has resulted in soft demand throw technological advances in there too for a complete picture of the oil and gas boom we are seeing i say the boom is happening in spite of obama administration policies i will be criticized by some on here that is ok average americans know the truth and the price at the pump can be lower here is a good read on this

today the house passed hr 5 the student success act i voted in favor of it because it restores local control of education by eliminating adequate yearly progress ayp the no child left behind report card requirement eliminating federal highly certified teacher requirements eliminating the federal governments ability to tell states how to spend their own education money maintenance of effort keeping federal funding at sequestration levels consolidating 70 funding programs into one single grant program eliminating taxpayer funded management positions at the department of education headquarters and blocking the federal government from mandating common core standards amendments also passed to remove federally mandated teacher evaluation requirements and to make title i dollars portable for public schools and charter schools if a state so chooses id like to thank everyone who responded to my facebook posts asking for feedback on this issue i read them all and your feedback helped me make decisions on dozens of amendments and on the overall passage of this bill i offered an amendment that would have gone even further in removing the federal government from education but unfortunately it was ruled out of order and was never considered however this bill does represent great progress in this area

the sequestration cuts set to take place today are an unfortunate symptom of a greater problem which is our governments failure to act to find bipartisan solutions to the critical issues we face we need to address our debt and cut spending but we need to do it in a responsible way not with debilitating across the board cuts that will set back our economic progress and cause deep cuts in places where we cant afford it i am very disappointed that congressional leadership has chosen to convene congress less than half of the working days this year rather than working out the details of a grand bargain based on shared sacrifice its clear that americans are fed up with the partisan gridlock and governing by crisis and so am i its time for congress to come together and take action to replace these potentially devastating cuts with a responsible and balanced alternative

yesterday speaking on the floor of the house of representatives i shared a story that is close to my heart a few years ago my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart due to her advanced age the doctors believed that surgery was too risky a few years later that aneurysm got worse endangering her life she was reevaluated and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery putting her faith in her doctors in our healthcare system and in her god she chose to have the surgery fortunately she made a full recovery however none of this would have been possible without medicare my mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker and did not have a private pension or any option other than medicare as congressional republicans look for an easy way out on these issues it is people like my mother who are left behind this is a personal issue to me and the millions of american families with similar stories republicans have tried for years to destroy medicare by turning it in to a voucher program they would break the promise we made to our nations seniors that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country boasting an overhead of only 2 the problem isnt medicare its the rising cost of healthcare one major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other we must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare as the representative of silicon valley i have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine personal health connected devices and other tools i will be reintroducing the healthcare innovation and marketplace technologies act later this year to continue this effort most importantly however i will continue to stand with my friends here in the congress to protect medicare and the medicare guarantee
i applaud the presidents speech tonight regarding jobs and technology we must ensure the resilience of the american worker and the adaptability and innovation inherent in our economy to keep us at the forefront of global competitiveness this is the silicon valley way of life and business where the manufacturing sector employs 1 in 5 workers more than twice the national average where breakthrough ideas are cultivated and where the worlds most successful visionaries and businesses call home if we renew our national commitment to winning the manufacturing jobs of the future bringing silicon valley sense to washington and employ strategies that play to our nations natural strengths we should see a new golden age of american manufacturing

todays jobs report is no cause for celebration the reason behind the drop in the unemployment rate is because americans are leaving the workforce in fact the labor force participation rate is at its lowest level in 35 years we need to focus on creating an environment where innovation small business and entrepreneurship can thrive that means removing roadblocks to job creation like obamacare and doddfrank and making america more energy independent at the current rate unemployment would actually be increasing if we take into account the number of people left behind by the governments calculation read more from the associated press the drop in the unemployment rate in august to a 4year low was hardly cause for celebration the rate fell because more people stopped looking for work more than 300000 people stopped working or looking for a job their exodus shrank the socalled labor force participation rate the percentage of adult americans with a job or seeking one to 632 percent its the lowest participation rate since august 1978 once people without a job stop looking for one the government no longer counts them as unemployed thats why the unemployment rate dropped to 73 percent in august from 74 percent in july even though 115000 fewer people said they had jobs if those who left the labor force last month had still been looking for work the unemployment rate would have risen to 75 percent in august fewerworkingageamericansareworking

this morning the judiciary committee is holding a hearing titled constitutional solution to our escalating national debt examining balanced budget amendments i support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget a balanced budget amendment would require washington to balance its budget just like the families and businesses in southwest missouri the house of representatives brought a balanced budget amendment to a vote on november 18 2011 i voted for the balanced budget amendment but unfortunately the measure failed to gain the twothirds majority vote it needed to pass
everyone while i encourage active debate lets please keep it civil so everyone can share their ideas in an open and honest forum thank you

its been more than three years since obamacare was signed into law but in that time the administration that created it has been unable to find a way to make it workable moreover it is deeply concerning that the administration is picking and choosing which parts of its own law it wants to follow even while it forces middleclass americans to comply the confusion costs and difficulty imposed on our families by this law and its subsequent mishandling are simply unacceptable

this morning we heard president obama emphatically state that the world set a redline regarding the use of chemical weapons by bashar alassads regime given his statement i felt it was appropriate to ask secretary kerry during his testimony if the world would join the united states in responding with multilateral military force unfortunately secretary kerrys response was unconvincing and led me to believe that the united states would be left to strike unilaterally and without a broad coalition of other nations during todays hearing the obama administration had an opportunity to make their case for military intervention in syrias longstanding civil war after listening to todays testimony i am at this time opposed to the use of us military force because the administration failed to present a convincing argument that the events in syria pose a clear threat to america failed to list a strong coalition of nations willing to support military attacks and failed to articulate a clear definition of victory while the use of chemical weapons should not be tolerated by any nation or regime the administration has not clearly answered these important questions and therefore has yet to convince the american people that military action is necessary at this time

as we await the presidents speech tonight with regard to executive amnesty i thought it would be useful to read a bit of what he has said in the past on the subject toward that end the speakers office circulated the list below and i thought you might find it of interest i take the constitution very seriously the biggest problems that were facing right now have to do with the president trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through congress at all and thats what i intend to reverse when im president of the united states of america 33108 weve got a government designed by the founders so that thered be checks and balances you dont want a president whos too powerful or a congress thats too powerful or a court thats too powerful everybodys got their own role congresss job is to pass legislation the president can veto it or he can sign it i believe in the constitution and i will obey the constitution of the united states were not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an endrun around congress 51908 comprehensive reform thats how were going to solve this problem anybody who tells you its going to be easy or that i can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasnt been paying attention to how this town works 5510 there are those in the immigrants rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are here illegally with legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws i believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair it would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration and it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally ultimately our nation like all nations has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship and no matter how decent they are no matter their reasons the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable 7110 i do have an obligation to make sure that i am following some of the rules i cant simply ignore laws that are out there ive got to work to make sure that they are changed 101410 i am president i am not king i cant do these things just by myself we have a system of government that requires the congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen im committed to making it happen but ive got to have some partners to do it the main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws the most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works again i just want to repeat im president im not king if congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported then i can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves but theres a limit to the discretion that i can show because i am obliged to execute the law thats what the executive branch means i cant just make the laws up by myself so the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws 102510 america is a nation of laws which means i as the president am obligated to enforce the law i dont have a choice about that thats part of my job but i can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants with respect to the notion that i can just suspend deportations through executive order thats just not the case because there are laws on the books that congress has passed weve got three branches of government congress passes the law the executive branchs job is to enforce and implement those laws and then the judiciary has to interpret the laws there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president 32811 i cant solve this problem by myself were going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen i cant do it by myself were going to have to change the laws in congress but im confident we can make it happen 42011 i know some here wish that i could just bypass congress and change the law myself but thats not how democracy works see democracy is hard but its right changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes one by one 42911 sometimes when i talk to immigration advocates they wish i could just bypass congress and change the law myself but thats not how a democracy works what we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine comprehensive reform that is the ultimate solution to this problem thats what im committed to doing 51011 i swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books now i know some people want me to bypass congress and change the laws on my own believe me the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting i promise you not just on immigration reform but thats not how our system works thats not how our democracy functions thats not how our constitution is written 72511 so what weve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books weve tried to be as fair humane just as we can recognizing though that the laws themselves need to be changed the most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws weve got to get it through the house of representatives which is currently controlled by republicans and weve got to get 60 votes in the senate administratively we cant ignore the law i just have to continue to say this notion that somehow i can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true we are doing everything we can administratively but the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that i have to enforce and i think theres been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the dream act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow by myself i can go and do these things its just not true we live in a democracy you have to pass bills through the legislature and then i can sign it and if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process then that is going to lead to a constant deadend we have to recognize how the system works and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and ultimately we can get this thing solved 92811 in june 2012 president obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals daca allowing eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization he then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own now what ive always said is as the head of the executive branch theres a limit to what i can do part of the reason that deportations went up was congress put a whole lot of money into it and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved then there are going to be higher numbers what weve said is lets make sure that youre not misdirecting those resources but were still going to ultimately have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally and thats why this continues to be a top priority of mine and we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible but until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization andor citizenship for the folks in question were going to continue to be bound by the law and so part of the challenge as president is constantly saying what authorities do i have 92012 we are a nation of immigrants but were also a nation of laws so what ive said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and ive done everything that i can on my own 101612 im not a king i am the head of the executive branch of government im required to follow the law and thats what weve done but what ive also said is lets make sure that were applying the law in a way that takes into account peoples humanity thats the reason that we moved forward on deferred action within the confines of the law we said we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law 13013 im not a king you know my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law and you know when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws weve got some discretion we can prioritize what we do but we cant simply ignore the law when it comes to the dreamers we were able to identify that group and say these folks are generally not a risk theyre not involved in crime and so lets prioritize our enforcement resources but to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do this is why we need comprehensive immigration reform to make sure that once and for all in a way that is you know ratified by congress we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble who are trying to do the right thing whove put down roots here my job is to carry out the law and so congress gives us a whole bunch of resources they give us an order that weve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books if this was an issue that i could do unilaterally i would have done it a long time ago the way our system works is congress has to pass legislation i then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it 13013 this is something ive struggled with throughout my presidency the problem is that im the president of the united states im not the emperor of the united states my job is to execute laws that are passed and congress right now has not changed what i consider to be a broken immigration system and what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic 21413 i think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative i can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus and weve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people but this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively 71613 my job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed congress has said here is the law when it comes to those who are undocumented and theyve allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement and what i have been able to do is to make a legal argument that i think is absolutely right which is that given the resources that we have we cant do everything that congress has asked us to do what we can do is then carve out the dream act folks saying young people who have basically grown up here are americans that we should welcome but if we start broadening that then essentially i would be ignoring the law in a way that i think would be very difficult to defend legally so thats not an option what ive said is there is a theres a path to get this done and thats through congress 91713 if in fact i could solve all these problems without passing laws in congress then i would do so but were also a nation of laws thats part of our tradition and so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like i can do something by violating our laws and what im proposing is the harder path which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve it is not simply a matter of us just saying were going to violate the law thats not our tradition the great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy and sometimes it is messy and sometimes it is hard but ultimately justice and truth win out 112513 i am the championinchief of comprehensive immigration reform but what ive said in the past remains true which is until congress passes a new law then i am constrained in terms of what i am able to do what ive done is to use my prosecutorial discretion because you cant enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people there arent the resources there what weve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity focus on people who are engaged in gang activity do not focus on young people who were calling dreamers that already stretched my administrative capacity very far but i was confident that that was the right thing to do but at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is congress said you have to enforce these laws they fund the hiring of officials at the department thats charged with enforcing and i cannot ignore those laws any more than i could ignore you know any of the other laws that are on the books thats why its so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year 3614 i think that i never have a green light to push the limits of executive power im bound by the constitution im bound by separation of powers there are some things we cant do congress has the power of the purse for example congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending so i dont have a green light my preference in all these instances is to work with congress because not only can congress do more but its going to be longerlasting 8614

analyses of the senates gang of eight bill show that the legislation would add 30 million additional immigrants to the united states over the next decade at a time when the number of americans not in the labor force has reached record highs experts say adding millions more to the labor force would harm working class americans by taking away jobs and lowering wages the congressional budget office has estimated wages would decline by 01 percent in the first decade first thing to keep in mind is its not a good time to push through anything even remotely resembling the gang of eight bill said peter kirsanow a member of the us commission on civil rights in an interview even in a roaring economy it would be a spectacularly bad idea

president obama will negotiate with the russians and the iranians but he will not come to capitol hill and talk with the duly elected representatives of the american people he wants to see the government shut down but that is not what we want or what hardworking americans want obamacare is not ready to be rolled out on october 1st and it is going to drive our economy into the fiscal ditch the house will vote on a delay of the individual mandate for one year we believe that americans should be afforded the same consideration that the president has promised to big business we also want fairness for all and have included a measure that will strip out the federal contribution for members staff the presidents cabinet and political appointees the house has been the only one fighting to avert a government shutdown we have worked through the weekend while the senate stayed in recess the president has refused to speak with the peoples elected representatives it is time for the senate and the president to become engaged and fight for commonsense solutions for the american people a government shutdown will only be temporary but obamacare is going to have long term consequences that will stifle our economy

the cost of health insurance premiums for a new customer in the individual market under obamacare will go up 151month on average and 130month for those keeping their current plan according to the white house we have nothing to worry about since customers will receive a 100 average rebate each year to offset these increased monthly costs thats right a 100 rebate to offset an annual increased premium cost of 1812 for new customers and 1560 for existing customers the presidents fuzzy math means that a lot of families and hardworking americans are going to have to further tighten their belts to foot the bill for this bad law this is wrong which is why in the house we continue to fight to repeal and replace obamacare with alternatives that will keep costs low and provide quality affordable health care for all americanssomething this law fails to do

for the past few weeks i have been undecided but leaning against authorizing military strikes in syria i was willing to remain open until president obama could make his case to the american people which he did from the east room last night after listening to the speech i have not been persuaded to support military action in syria unfortunately the speech left unanswered questions about whether or not the administration has a specific plan for a limited military action that will advance broader strategic objectives it also remains unclear what sorts of planning the administration is undertaking for various contingencies that might arise as a result of the strike this is consistent with the lack of detail i have received in classified briefings with administration officials at the very least clarity and more forthcoming responses on these issues is necessary before i would consider supporting military action i hold out hope that recent diplomatic developments will bring about a peaceful resolution to the situation but i also realize that a deal brokered by the russians is unlikely to be on balance a very good deal and will remain difficult to implement while we wait for the diplomatic track to play itself out the white house must engage congress in a deeper and more open manner than they have thus far
