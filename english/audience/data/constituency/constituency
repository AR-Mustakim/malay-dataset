senator corker released the following statement today regarding reports that three of the companies offering insurance policies in the federal health care marketplace in tennessee have requested to raise rates for their exchange plans in 2015 my heart goes out to the many families and business owners across the state coping with rising health care costs and im hopeful the senate might finally be allowed to debate ways to provide relief from the damaging effects of this law including solutions to free up the marketplace so affordable plans that meet the actual needs of tennesseans can openly and effectively compete for their business said corker the presidents health care bill was sold to tennesseans and the country as a way to bring down health care costs yet it has done just the opposite as we continue to see double digit increases in the cost of plans bluecross blueshield of tennessee bcbst the only health insurance provider to offer a policy in all 95 volunteer state counties in 2014 is requesting to raise rates by an average of 19 percent for its exchange plans in 2015 cigna is requesting an average rate increase of 75 percent and humana has requested to raise rates by an average of 144 percent during the health care laws 2014 open enrollment period 88 percent of tennesseans chose a bcbst health insurance plan
senator corker expressed strong disappointment that congress will not vote on senator coburns amendment that would free the postal service to make one change it believes is necessary to reduce costs specifically senate amendment 68 which corker has cosponsored would strike language in the cr that could mandate sixday delivery the postal service estimates it would save roughly 2 billion a year by moving to fiveday delivery for some postal products this is typical washingtonwanting to have our cake and eat it too we all know that we need to allow the postal service the flexibility to make necessary reforms and cut costs so it can operate more efficiently and effectively and yet congress continues to stand in the way this is a missed opportunity to enable the postal service to enact reforms it sees are necessary in order to reduce risk for taxpayers

more debt w zero spending reforms unacceptable i strongly believe we must act to avoid defaulting on our debt payments and reopen the government but i cannot support a plan that increases our nations debt by half a trillion dollars while offering no spending reforms washingtons addiction to spending is what led to this mess and piling on more debt while ignoring the spending problem is exactly the wrong approach a better way forward would be honest simple legislation that 1 takes care of our debt needs with corresponding spending reforms 2 provides temporary government funding and 3 allows us time to work toward a real budget i know a majority of republicans and democrats would ultimately support such a plan the problem is the shutdown strategy damaged the houses bargaining power in these negotiations i hope conservatives can now regroup and begin work on achievable priorities that are important to regular americans striving to protect americans from obamacares harmful mandates and taxes setting sustainable spending levels that continue to drive down the deficit and pushing a progrowth agenda that will help create jobs for people in alabama and throughout the country robytovotenoon
