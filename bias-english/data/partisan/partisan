i was very proud to lead a group of my colleagues in speaking on the floor of the house last night to promote and support hr 3685 the protecting volunteer firefighters and emergency responders act this legislation is necessary to protect volunteer firefighters from unintended consequences of the affordable care act aca the bill has more than 80 cosponsors including members of both parties an unexpected and previously undetected problem with the law represents special and urgent circumstances this really took me by surprise the fact that the aca could force volunteer fire companies to provide health insurance to their volunteers or pay a fine that would burden them with unbearable costs and possibly cause them to reduce the number of volunteers they have or shut their doors altogether simply put this is a public safety issue ive been concerned that since the internal revenue service irs currently views volunteer firefighters as employees fire companies and municipalities would be forced to provide health insurance or pay a fine saddling them with unbearable financial burdens and threatening public safety i sent the irs a letter in november requesting a clarification but the correspondence has gone unanswered as of today under the employer mandate provision employers with 50 or more employees must provide health insurance or pay penalties this could be problematic for fire companies particularly in pennsylvania where 97percent of stations rely exclusively or mostly on volunteers fire companies could exceed the 50 employee threshold in several different ways by themselves based on their size by being part of a larger combined force under several different chiefs or by being part of a municipality that has 50 or more public employees in total some fire companies may hear about this and immediately think well weve only got 25 volunteers so were safe we dont have fifty that may not necessarily be the case some fire companies are considered part of their local government that could mean that if you take the number of firefighters paid and unpaid now considered employees by the irs and add them to the number of other public employees you can easily reach fifty even in a small town

president obama has previously described his healthcare law as a new set of rules that treats everybody honestly and treats everybody fairly but as of a few weeks ago according to pres obama if youre a big financial institution or government contractor you dont have to comply with obamacares mandate next year but if youre a tennessee family trying to make ends meet you do or you get taxed and to add insult to injury the president now has the gall to say that he will veto the house passed the legislation delaying obamacares employer mandate and individual mandate his veto threat is a pathetic excuse for leadership share like if you want the senate to follow the houses lead and call the presidents bluff by passing these common sense bills to give all americans muchneeded relief from obamacare #trainwreck #fairnessforall #tbt

the senseless targeting of innocent civilians has to be stopped it is unacceptable under any circumstances my thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and injured in the #jerusalem attack as well as the people of #israel who have endured far too many of these brutal assaults the united states will continue to fight against such atrocities and bring to justice those who commit such acts as the strongest of allies and partners in combating terrorism we reaffirm our support for israels right to defend and protect its people
#scotus got it wrong with #hobbylobby thats why im supporting the protect womens health from corporate interference act the legislation would restore the contraceptive coverage requirement guaranteed by the #acat and protect coverage of other health services from employers who want to impose their beliefs on their employees by denying benefits allowing employers to force their own religious beliefs on their employees under the guise of religious freedom is inexplicable the supreme court has put the health of american women at risk while opening the door for private employers who are looking for a reason not to comply with the law whether a woman uses contraception should be a private decision not subject to a financial veto by her employer the affordable care act guarantees the majority of women coverage for comprehensive preventive health services including contraception imposing additional financial burdens on a woman because her employer claims to hold certain beliefs contrary to the law sets a dangerous precedent #notmybossbusiness
not one single republican showed up for todays scheduled epw committee markup this is very sad this is obstructionism pure and simple it has nothing to do with gina mccarthy it has nothing to do with the answers she supplied this committee it is republican obstructionism she has answered over 1000 questions which is unprecedented the maximum number before was in the three hundreds when lisa jackson was confirmed there were about 100 questions asked this has been a pattern on the republican side of the aisle with obstructing president obamas nominations yesterday we saw in one of our committees a technical rule used to block the vote for tom perez to be secretary of labor this is a pattern of blocking confirmation votes for president obamas nominees for key cabinet positions this is wrong

ben commonsense laws concerning things as powerful as guns should not be a partisan issue in the wake of mass shootings and in the face of daily shootings across the us it is time to say enough is enough we can reduce the needless violence by making logical policy decisions that respect the second amendment while protecting human lives president obama should be supported in his efforts to explore how we can make the country safer by looking at our laws health system culture and more follow link for official press release

we need to have special elections in new york state there are now 500000 people in brooklyn without a member of the state assembly and another 300000 people without a member of the state senate the communities marine park and crown heights brownsville and canarsie gerritsen beach and east new york have been denied a voice in albany

for the first time in four years we are in a position to pass a budget agreement with strong bipartisan support in both the house and the senate the bill is not perfect and neither side is happy with everything in the agreement however in a year filled with far too much partisan fighting this compromise is an important step forward programs that help create jobs in pennsylvania such as community development block grants and nih medical research will likely face fewer cuts under this deal in addition overall deficit reduction will be approximately 20 billion higher under this agreement than without it moreover the bill will allow us avoid another damaging government shutdown i am hopeful that the measure will pass the senate and that the spirit of bipartisanship will continue into next year #budget
unfortunately due to the absence of a congressional agreement on appropriations for fiscal year 2014 my senate office is unable to maintain normal operations if you have an emergency involving federal benefits such as those provided by the veterans administration or social security please email our office at casework@caseysenategov if you would like to share information about how the federal government shutdown has impacted you please email shutdown@caseysenategov i am sorry for any inconvenience this unfortunate situation may cause you my staff and i look forward to continuing the excellent constituent service you expect when the federal government is fully funded
senator corker released the following statement today regarding reports that three of the companies offering insurance policies in the federal health care marketplace in tennessee have requested to raise rates for their exchange plans in 2015 my heart goes out to the many families and business owners across the state coping with rising health care costs and im hopeful the senate might finally be allowed to debate ways to provide relief from the damaging effects of this law including solutions to free up the marketplace so affordable plans that meet the actual needs of tennesseans can openly and effectively compete for their business said corker the presidents health care bill was sold to tennesseans and the country as a way to bring down health care costs yet it has done just the opposite as we continue to see double digit increases in the cost of plans bluecross blueshield of tennessee bcbst the only health insurance provider to offer a policy in all 95 volunteer state counties in 2014 is requesting to raise rates by an average of 19 percent for its exchange plans in 2015 cigna is requesting an average rate increase of 75 percent and humana has requested to raise rates by an average of 144 percent during the health care laws 2014 open enrollment period 88 percent of tennesseans chose a bcbst health insurance plan
senator corker expressed strong disappointment that congress will not vote on senator coburns amendment that would free the postal service to make one change it believes is necessary to reduce costs specifically senate amendment 68 which corker has cosponsored would strike language in the cr that could mandate sixday delivery the postal service estimates it would save roughly 2 billion a year by moving to fiveday delivery for some postal products this is typical washingtonwanting to have our cake and eat it too we all know that we need to allow the postal service the flexibility to make necessary reforms and cut costs so it can operate more efficiently and effectively and yet congress continues to stand in the way this is a missed opportunity to enable the postal service to enact reforms it sees are necessary in order to reduce risk for taxpayers

the senate majority wants to extend emergency unemployment insurance without allowing a fair debate and votes on minority amendments unemployment benefits do have a cost this expenditure should be recognized and paid for instead of just adding billions of dollars to our debt every few months people are having a hard time supporting their families but the answer isnt a federal program that borrows more money the answer is policies that allow the private sector to create the jobs people need

the sequestration cuts set to take place today are an unfortunate symptom of a greater problem which is our governments failure to act to find bipartisan solutions to the critical issues we face we need to address our debt and cut spending but we need to do it in a responsible way not with debilitating across the board cuts that will set back our economic progress and cause deep cuts in places where we cant afford it i am very disappointed that congressional leadership has chosen to convene congress less than half of the working days this year rather than working out the details of a grand bargain based on shared sacrifice its clear that americans are fed up with the partisan gridlock and governing by crisis and so am i its time for congress to come together and take action to replace these potentially devastating cuts with a responsible and balanced alternative

in my latest installment of ask peter i respond to an email from karen werle in algonquin who asked about #obamacare architect jonathan grubers comments that passing obamacare relied on the stupidity of the american voter and a lack of transparency the american people are not fooled this law was crafted behind closed doors and rammed through congress on a partisan voteand the results have been disastrous as a result millions have been kicked off their healthcare plans or have seen their premiums skyrocket while businesses have been forced to cutback their workforces thats why i introduced legislation to create an independent watchdog to monitor obamacare which would help bring muchneeded transparency and accountability to the presidents healthcare law #grubergate
today i asked the nonpartisan congressional research service congresss research arm to investigate president obamas authority to delay the employer mandate required by the affordable care act the administrations delay is a formal admission that this law cant be fixed delaying the employer mandatewhile preserving the requirement that individuals purchase insuranceonly postpones the inevitable catastrophe that is obamacare this action raises a lot of questions about whether the obama administration can simply ignore the law when its convenient for them as chairman of the subcommittee on health employment labor and pensions i am going to get to the bottom of this question

this morning we heard president obama emphatically state that the world set a redline regarding the use of chemical weapons by bashar alassads regime given his statement i felt it was appropriate to ask secretary kerry during his testimony if the world would join the united states in responding with multilateral military force unfortunately secretary kerrys response was unconvincing and led me to believe that the united states would be left to strike unilaterally and without a broad coalition of other nations during todays hearing the obama administration had an opportunity to make their case for military intervention in syrias longstanding civil war after listening to todays testimony i am at this time opposed to the use of us military force because the administration failed to present a convincing argument that the events in syria pose a clear threat to america failed to list a strong coalition of nations willing to support military attacks and failed to articulate a clear definition of victory while the use of chemical weapons should not be tolerated by any nation or regime the administration has not clearly answered these important questions and therefore has yet to convince the american people that military action is necessary at this time
earlier today i spoke with msnbcs tamron hall about our operations in syria i believe we cannot and should not address the threat of isis alone and i applaud the president for partnering with neighboring arab nations with these strikes however i remain very concerned about details long term strategy and who our military will be partnering with on the ground in syria
the voice of the american people should be louder than the voice of a few bank accounts but todays supreme court decision undermines that principle the mccutcheon decision does nothing but allow the wealthiest americans were talking little more than 1 of the 1 influence politics more than they already do this means any individual would be able to contribute 36 million to their political interests almost 30 times the current limit how many americans do you know that could do that this decision comes at the expense of everyday americans and the public interest #bythepeople

as we await the presidents speech tonight with regard to executive amnesty i thought it would be useful to read a bit of what he has said in the past on the subject toward that end the speakers office circulated the list below and i thought you might find it of interest i take the constitution very seriously the biggest problems that were facing right now have to do with the president trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through congress at all and thats what i intend to reverse when im president of the united states of america 33108 weve got a government designed by the founders so that thered be checks and balances you dont want a president whos too powerful or a congress thats too powerful or a court thats too powerful everybodys got their own role congresss job is to pass legislation the president can veto it or he can sign it i believe in the constitution and i will obey the constitution of the united states were not going to use signing statements as a way of doing an endrun around congress 51908 comprehensive reform thats how were going to solve this problem anybody who tells you its going to be easy or that i can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasnt been paying attention to how this town works 5510 there are those in the immigrants rights community who have argued passionately that we should simply provide those who are here illegally with legal status or at least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better laws i believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair it would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration and it would also ignore the millions of people around the world who are waiting in line to come here legally ultimately our nation like all nations has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citizenship and no matter how decent they are no matter their reasons the 11 million who broke these laws should be held accountable 7110 i do have an obligation to make sure that i am following some of the rules i cant simply ignore laws that are out there ive got to work to make sure that they are changed 101410 i am president i am not king i cant do these things just by myself we have a system of government that requires the congress to work with the executive branch to make it happen im committed to making it happen but ive got to have some partners to do it the main thing we have to do to stop deportations is to change the laws the most important thing that we can do is to change the law because the way the system works again i just want to repeat im president im not king if congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported then i can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources to focus on people who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves but theres a limit to the discretion that i can show because i am obliged to execute the law thats what the executive branch means i cant just make the laws up by myself so the most important thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying laws 102510 america is a nation of laws which means i as the president am obligated to enforce the law i dont have a choice about that thats part of my job but i can advocate for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation of immigrants with respect to the notion that i can just suspend deportations through executive order thats just not the case because there are laws on the books that congress has passed weve got three branches of government congress passes the law the executive branchs job is to enforce and implement those laws and then the judiciary has to interpret the laws there are enough laws on the books by congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president 32811 i cant solve this problem by myself were going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it happen i cant do it by myself were going to have to change the laws in congress but im confident we can make it happen 42011 i know some here wish that i could just bypass congress and change the law myself but thats not how democracy works see democracy is hard but its right changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds and changing votes one by one 42911 sometimes when i talk to immigration advocates they wish i could just bypass congress and change the law myself but thats not how a democracy works what we really need to do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine comprehensive reform that is the ultimate solution to this problem thats what im committed to doing 51011 i swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books now i know some people want me to bypass congress and change the laws on my own believe me the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting i promise you not just on immigration reform but thats not how our system works thats not how our democracy functions thats not how our constitution is written 72511 so what weve tried to do is within the constraints of the laws on the books weve tried to be as fair humane just as we can recognizing though that the laws themselves need to be changed the most important thing for your viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in order to change our laws weve got to get it through the house of representatives which is currently controlled by republicans and weve got to get 60 votes in the senate administratively we cant ignore the law i just have to continue to say this notion that somehow i can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true we are doing everything we can administratively but the fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that i have to enforce and i think theres been a great disservice done to the cause of getting the dream act passed and getting comprehensive immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow by myself i can go and do these things its just not true we live in a democracy you have to pass bills through the legislature and then i can sign it and if all the attention is focused away from the legislative process then that is going to lead to a constant deadend we have to recognize how the system works and then apply pressure to those places where votes can be gotten and ultimately we can get this thing solved 92811 in june 2012 president obama unilaterally granted deferred action for childhood arrivals daca allowing eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization he then argued that he had already done everything he could legally do on his own now what ive always said is as the head of the executive branch theres a limit to what i can do part of the reason that deportations went up was congress put a whole lot of money into it and when you have a lot of resources and a lot more agents involved then there are going to be higher numbers what weve said is lets make sure that youre not misdirecting those resources but were still going to ultimately have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally and thats why this continues to be a top priority of mine and we will continue to make sure that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible but until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for legalization andor citizenship for the folks in question were going to continue to be bound by the law and so part of the challenge as president is constantly saying what authorities do i have 92012 we are a nation of immigrants but were also a nation of laws so what ive said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and ive done everything that i can on my own 101612 im not a king i am the head of the executive branch of government im required to follow the law and thats what weve done but what ive also said is lets make sure that were applying the law in a way that takes into account peoples humanity thats the reason that we moved forward on deferred action within the confines of the law we said we have some discretion in terms of how we apply this law 13013 im not a king you know my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law and you know when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws weve got some discretion we can prioritize what we do but we cant simply ignore the law when it comes to the dreamers we were able to identify that group and say these folks are generally not a risk theyre not involved in crime and so lets prioritize our enforcement resources but to sort through all the possible cases of everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very difficult to do this is why we need comprehensive immigration reform to make sure that once and for all in a way that is you know ratified by congress we can say that there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying out of trouble who are trying to do the right thing whove put down roots here my job is to carry out the law and so congress gives us a whole bunch of resources they give us an order that weve got to go out there and enforce the laws that are on the books if this was an issue that i could do unilaterally i would have done it a long time ago the way our system works is congress has to pass legislation i then get an opportunity to sign it and implement it 13013 this is something ive struggled with throughout my presidency the problem is that im the president of the united states im not the emperor of the united states my job is to execute laws that are passed and congress right now has not changed what i consider to be a broken immigration system and what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic 21413 i think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative i can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus and weve been able to provide help through deferred action for young people but this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively 71613 my job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed congress has said here is the law when it comes to those who are undocumented and theyve allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement and what i have been able to do is to make a legal argument that i think is absolutely right which is that given the resources that we have we cant do everything that congress has asked us to do what we can do is then carve out the dream act folks saying young people who have basically grown up here are americans that we should welcome but if we start broadening that then essentially i would be ignoring the law in a way that i think would be very difficult to defend legally so thats not an option what ive said is there is a theres a path to get this done and thats through congress 91713 if in fact i could solve all these problems without passing laws in congress then i would do so but were also a nation of laws thats part of our tradition and so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like i can do something by violating our laws and what im proposing is the harder path which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve it is not simply a matter of us just saying were going to violate the law thats not our tradition the great thing about this country is we have this wonderful process of democracy and sometimes it is messy and sometimes it is hard but ultimately justice and truth win out 112513 i am the championinchief of comprehensive immigration reform but what ive said in the past remains true which is until congress passes a new law then i am constrained in terms of what i am able to do what ive done is to use my prosecutorial discretion because you cant enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million people there arent the resources there what weve said is focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity focus on people who are engaged in gang activity do not focus on young people who were calling dreamers that already stretched my administrative capacity very far but i was confident that that was the right thing to do but at a certain point the reason that these deportations are taking place is congress said you have to enforce these laws they fund the hiring of officials at the department thats charged with enforcing and i cannot ignore those laws any more than i could ignore you know any of the other laws that are on the books thats why its so important for us to get comprehensive immigration reform done this year 3614 i think that i never have a green light to push the limits of executive power im bound by the constitution im bound by separation of powers there are some things we cant do congress has the power of the purse for example congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending so i dont have a green light my preference in all these instances is to work with congress because not only can congress do more but its going to be longerlasting 8614

president obama will negotiate with the russians and the iranians but he will not come to capitol hill and talk with the duly elected representatives of the american people he wants to see the government shut down but that is not what we want or what hardworking americans want obamacare is not ready to be rolled out on october 1st and it is going to drive our economy into the fiscal ditch the house will vote on a delay of the individual mandate for one year we believe that americans should be afforded the same consideration that the president has promised to big business we also want fairness for all and have included a measure that will strip out the federal contribution for members staff the presidents cabinet and political appointees the house has been the only one fighting to avert a government shutdown we have worked through the weekend while the senate stayed in recess the president has refused to speak with the peoples elected representatives it is time for the senate and the president to become engaged and fight for commonsense solutions for the american people a government shutdown will only be temporary but obamacare is going to have long term consequences that will stifle our economy

the cost of health insurance premiums for a new customer in the individual market under obamacare will go up 151month on average and 130month for those keeping their current plan according to the white house we have nothing to worry about since customers will receive a 100 average rebate each year to offset these increased monthly costs thats right a 100 rebate to offset an annual increased premium cost of 1812 for new customers and 1560 for existing customers the presidents fuzzy math means that a lot of families and hardworking americans are going to have to further tighten their belts to foot the bill for this bad law this is wrong which is why in the house we continue to fight to repeal and replace obamacare with alternatives that will keep costs low and provide quality affordable health care for all americanssomething this law fails to do

today us senator tom udall issued the following statement on the presidents decision to take executive action on immigration over 40000 people in new mexico and millions more around the country are living in immigration limbo while they work and raise families here in the united states deporting these children and families isnt a realistic option we need to focus our limited resources on securing the border and going after drug dealers gang members and potential terrorists new mexicans have seen firsthand the problems caused by house republicans who have dragged their feet on immigration for too long it has been 511 days since the senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive reform bill because the house wont act the president is justified in taking commonsense steps to fix our broken immigration system under existing law the president is offering a temporary solution to keep families together give employers who hire workers on visas more certainty about their workforce and devote our limited resources to deporting dangerous criminals its past time for congress to work together on a permanent fix of our broken immigration system

for many hardworking families in the 2nd district balancing the demands of family and the workplace can be difficult state and local government employees have long been able to choose paid time off as compensation for working overtime hours allowing these publicsector employees greater flexibility to meet family obligations however the federal government prohibits privatesector workers from enjoying this same benefit to remove this obstacle in federal law the united states house of representatives will be voting on the working families flexibility act of 2013 this commonsense legislation allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked it is profamily proworker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family attend teacher conferences care for aging parents stay home with a newborn or attend to other family needs that may arise how would you spend your time if congress passed this legislation
